EDITORS’ PREFACE
DAVID H. GUSTON, ED FINN, AND JASON SCOTT ROBERT
No work of literature has done more to shape the way humans imagine
science and its moral consequences than Frankenstein; or The Modern
Prometheus, Mary Shelley’s remarkably enduring tale of creation and
responsibility. Frankenstein is the literary offspring of an eighteen-yearold girl ensconced in a romantic yet fraught summer getaway on the shores
of Lake Geneva in response to a “dare” to come up with a ghost story.
That dare was issued a little more than two hundred years ago. In writing
Frankenstein, Mary produced both in the creature and in its creator tropes
that continue to resonate deeply with contemporary audiences. Moreover,
these tropes and the imaginations they engender actually influence the
way we confront emerging science and technology, conceptualize the process of scientific research, imagine the motivations and ethical struggles of
scientists, and weigh the benefits of scientific research against its anticipated and unforeseen pitfalls.
The world will celebrate the bicentennial of Frankenstein’s publication
on 1 January 2018. Arizona State University (ASU) will be the epicenter
of this celebration of the power of literature, science, art, imagination, and
ingenuity. ASU’s Frankenstein Bicentennial Project is a constructive, intellectual, and public endeavor meant to celebrate Frankenstein’s pervasive
influence on contemporary culture and scientific research. With funding
from the US National Science Foundation (NSF Award no. 1516684), we are
producing a citizen-curated, digital narrative experience of Frankenstein
and Frankensteiniana in collaboration with dozens of museums and other
partners. Our goal is to understand the galvanizing power of Frankenstein
to stoke the public imagination and to harness that energy to ignite new
conversations about creativity and responsibility among science and technology researchers, students, and the public. We hope these conversations
will inspire a deeper understanding of how to govern science and technology responsibly. We believe Frankenstein is a book that can encourage us
to be both thoughtful and hopeful: having these conversations can help all
of us make better decisions about how to shape and understand scientific
research and technical innovation in ways that support our well-considered values and ambitions.
Mary Shelley’s landmark fusion of science, ethics, and literary expression provides an opportunity both to reflect on how science is framed and
understood by the public and to contextualize new scientific and technological innovations, especially in an era of synthetic biology, genome editing,
robotics, machine learning, and regenerative medicine. Although Frankenstein is infused with the exhilaration of seemingly unbounded human
creativity, it also prompts serious reflection about our individual and 
xii Editors’ Preface
collective responsibility for nurturing the products of our creativity and
imposing constraints on our capacities to change the world around us.
Engaging with Frankenstein allows a broad public and especially future
scientists and engineers to consider the history of our scientific progress
together with our expanding abilities in the future and to reflect on evolving understandings of the responsibilities such abilities entail.
•••
This critical edition of Frankenstein for scientists and engineers is—like
the creature himself—the first of its kind and just as monstrous in its
composition and development. Originally proposed by our colleague Cajsa
Baldini in ASU’s Department of English, the skeleton of the critical edition
was fleshed out at a workshop at ASU in the spring of 2014, hosted by two
of us (Guston and Finn) and funded by the NSF (NSF Award no. 1354287)
to explore science-and-society projects that might be built around Frankenstein). Robert served as scribe in breakout sessions dedicated to fleshing
out the critical edition, which also included Baldini, historian Catherine
O’Donnell, and representatives from the ASU Libraries, a local high school,
and the larger community. We then sent copies of Frankenstein to professors
and students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)
fields and asked them to identify key terms and passages requiring elucidation and elaboration for STEM students from high school to graduate
school. We received almost one thousand suggestions! And so the editorial
work began in earnest.
In the spring of 2015, still working with NSF funding, we brought together
a small group of advisers to discuss both a print version and an immersive digital version of an annotated Frankenstein. One key contributor was
Charles E. Robinson, emeritus professor at the University of Delaware and
one of the world’s leading scholars of Frankenstein. Robinson graciously
offered us the opportunity to use his painstakingly line-edited and amended
version of the original manuscript published in 1818 as our core text. The
workshop yielded a strong sense of what distinguishes our critical edition
from previous ones, which have dwelt on the novel’s literary or historical
importance, addressing it as representative of romanticism or the gothic.
Other volumes have focused on the science or ethics of Frankenstein or
both, but they have been either critical anthologies or otherwise engaged
with the novel in a secondary fashion. We wanted our version to be unique
in bringing together the primary text and annotations and short essays
by a diverse group of experts. This juxtaposition will allow STEM readers
to explore critical understandings of the ethical and societal dimensions 
Editors’ Preface xiii
of scientific inquiry in the immediate company of Victor Frankenstein, his
creature, and a gripping narrative of creativity and responsibility.1
 Rather
than focusing on the specifics of the science and what Mary Shelley got or
did not get right,2
 our version (although including some such discussion)
emphasizes broader questions of the scientific endeavor, the roles of scientists, and the relationship between scientific creativity and responsibility.
With the serial and at times massively parallel assistance of Valerye
Milleson, Mary Drago, and Joey Eschrich, we vetted the lengthy list of suggested annotations and then solicited, assigned, collected, edited, amplified,
truncated, massaged, and merged the annotations into the far-ranging
critical conversation composing this volume. We also identified key themes
to be highlighted in longer essays—including creativity, imagination, monstrosity, angst, responsibility, and the roles of gender in Frankenstein and
in science and engineering—and commissioned essays from leading scholars
and writers at ASU, across the United States, and around the world. The
end result, we believe, is an edition of Frankenstein that incites a deeply
engaging cross-disciplinary exploration of the complexities of the development of personal and professional identity and of the rightful place of
science and scientists in our rapidly changing world.
•••
In organizing and editing this material, we were faced with innumerable
decisions about style and content. Upon reflection, perhaps the most consequential are the naming conventions we have adopted. First, we have
decided to refer to the author and her main protagonist simply as Mary
and Victor wherever possible. We do not wish to diminish them with this
familiarity, but we do wish precisely to render them more familiar. Mary
was eighteen years old when she began to set her ideas to paper. Victor was
a young man, still very much a student. Both of them are more like you,
the reader, in that sense than like us. We want you to see them more as
colleagues, classmates, and maybe even as friends rather than as a distant
contributor to the literary canon and the maniacal character she devised.
Recognizing—as many have before us, from the author of Genesis to
Mary herself—that to name something is to assert some measure of creative
power over it, we have decided to attempt to consistently identify Victor’s
creation as “the creature.” We do this for several reasons, foremost among
them to allow readers to determine for themselves whether the appellations
daemon (frequently used in the text) and monster (most often used in posterity) are appropriate. For us, creature is a more neutral, descriptive, and
pedagogically appropriate denomination.
xiv Editors’ Preface
It is worth pointing out that the way we now use the word creature
ignores a richer etymology. Today, we refer to birds and bees as creatures.
Living things are creatures by virtue of their living-ness. When we call
something a creature today, we rarely think in terms of something that
has been created, and thus we erase the idea of a creator behind the creature. We have likewise lost the social connotation of the term creature, for
creatures are made not just biologically (or magically) but also socially. In
the contemporary film Victor Frankenstein (2015), for example, Harry Potter’s
Daniel Radcliffe plays Igor—Victor’s hunchback assistant not present in
Mary’s novel but invented for stage and screen—who is rescued from a
circus, cured of his malformation, and embraced by Victor first as assistant
and then as partner in his laboratory. Victor raises him from a subhuman existence, even giving him the name “Igor” because the freak-show
hunchback has no name, and makes him an English gentleman worthy of
invitations to clubs and balls and even the affection of a beautiful woman.
Igor understands that he is Victor’s creature in this regard, just as surely
as if his life were created from nonlife. So to recognize both the biological
and the social aspects of creation—as well as the failure of Mary’s Victor to
name his creation, thus rejecting the creature’s social creation—we have
decided on “the creature.” So Mary, Victor, and the creature constitute the
trinity of our text.
We also want to reflect on the fact that we are a trio of roughly middleaged guys potentially appropriating Mary’s work. Although changing the
biological aspects of our identities for the purposes of this volume is not
really an option, we can consider what it was like for us to confront issues
of gender in Frankenstein and raise these issues for ourselves and for our
readers. First, we must emphasize again that although the idea for the
Frankenstein Bicentennial Project came from one of us, the idea for this
volume came from our colleague Cajsa Baldini. As a lecturer in English
at ASU, Cajsa is in a more vulnerable academic position than we are (two
of us are tenured, one is on the tenure track). She had the further burden,
familiar to many women, of family medical challenges that ultimately
caused her to pass the project to us. Without her creative spark, this project
would never have existed, and we are grateful for her blessing and her
willingness to allow us to pursue the work in her stead.
It may be difficult for some readers, especially those accustomed to
living the relatively privileged life of the white male, to recognize how hard
it was for Mary to write and publish this book as a young woman without
money or the support of her family (with the exception of her husband, the
poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, who was just as much an outcast as she was). 
Editors’ Preface xv
When the first edition appeared in 1818, it listed no author, and some
reviewers and readers assumed Percy was the real architect of the narrative. Several reviewers who knew the truth found it deeply alarming: the
British Critic blamed the flaws it perceived in the text on the gender of its
author, brutally ending its review by saying, “The writer of it is, we understand, a female; this is an aggravation of that which is the prevailing fault
of the novel; but if our authoress can forget the gentleness of her sex, it is
no reason why we should; and we shall therefore dismiss the novel without
further comment” (“Review of Frankenstein” 1818). It was only one of the
many times Mary was excluded from consideration because of her gender
and her unconventional choices.
We can also speak of what it was like to learn from Mary because any
failure on our part to acknowledge the sheer brilliance of her composition,
its heritage and its progeny, its intricacies and its clarion vision, would
be a failure as colossal as Victor’s failure to acknowledge the intelligence
of his creature—except that we are Mary’s creatures and not the other
way around. As university teachers, we know—but we do not always show—
that our students have things to teach us. We do not labor under the misapprehension that we are bringing very much at all to Mary; rather, our
hope is to bring Mary more clearly and powerfully to you. This endeavor
requires, as we hope we have done through the invited essays and annotations, the recognition that Mary was not just an interesting writer but
also a powerful thinker. Her parents—the feminist philosopher Mary Wollstonecraft, who died as a consequence of Mary’s birth, and the similarly
radical political philosopher William Godwin—provided her with the raw
material. Tales of her intensive tutoring bring to mind that imposed by
other nineteenth-century tiger fathers such as James Mill, who in educating
John Stuart Mill produced a nervous breakdown in his son before producing a political theorist who surpassed him. Turning gender roles around,
Mary did not turn inward and anxious but instead turned outward and
rebellious. Sixteen-year-old Mary ran off with Percy from England to continental Europe, returning shortly after only to run off again on the jaunt
that led to her to imagine Frankenstein. Mary was doing drugs (laudanum, a
powdered opiate) and became pregnant by a man who was at the time married to someone else: if she had turned up at ASU or any other school, she
would have been labeled an “at-risk student” and targeted for intervention.
And the risks she faced were significant. By the time Mary began writing Frankenstein, she had already become a mother and lost a child. Little
Clara arrived two months early in February 1815, only to die two weeks
later, to Mary’s harrowing sorrow. Mary wrote later of a “waking dream” 
xvi Editors’ Preface
that inspired Frankenstein in which she managed to revive baby Clara by
moving her closer to the fire and nursing her to health. Mary would give
birth to four children in all and bury three of them. Throughout Mary’s life,
birth and death were intimately connected. The themes of parenthood and
responsibility in Frankenstein, of lost creatures and dead children, were
visceral experiences for Mary. Among its many faces, Frankenstein was a
very personal ghost story for its author.
After Frankenstein was published, Mary’s life was perhaps even more
challenging. She lost two other children, largely because of traveling with
them across Europe in precarious conditions for the sake of her beloved
Percy, and then she lost him, too, when he drowned in Italy at the age of
twenty-nine. A less-resilient heroine of novels of Mary’s time might have
followed Percy to the grave by her own hand. Mary persisted. And just as
we are in the thrall of her intellectual power, we are in awe of her resilience and emotional strength.3
The questions of gender and marginality come to the fore in several of
the essays we have collected in this volume, specifically in the contributions
by scholar Anne K. Mellor and fiction writer Elizabeth Bear. We subscribe
to the idea that only Mary, with her bodily experience and embodied wisdom, could have written Frankenstein with such profundity. Indeed, questions about Mary’s authorship persisted even after her name as author
was first revealed; later critics supposed that it was really Percy’s work,
as if Mary could not have done it. To be sure, Percy contributed a great
deal. But if you have visited the manuscript and fair copy at the Bodleian
Library at the University of Oxford and been given a brilliant tour of its
revelatory details by Bruce Barker-Benfield (as one of us has), you can see
exactly how she did it—the dynamics of love and creativity played out in
the looping flow of Mary’s authorial hand and the angular interjections of
Percy’s editorial additions. This book by a young woman who would spend
hours reading literature, philosophy, and history by her mother’s grave,
who was cut off by her father when she fled to Europe with Percy, and who
lost a child of her own at seventeen is singular. No one else before or since
could have written Frankenstein with the same combination of intellectual
breadth, moral depth, and intense personal experience.
•••
We also feel it is important to make the case for bringing Mary, Victor, and
the creature into the heart of conversations about contemporary science
and technology. Of course, it is a privilege to engage with one of the most
influential and widely assigned (if not as widely read) novels in the 
Editors’ Preface xvii
English language and one that has inspired so many high and low cultural
expressions. That fecundity reveals something important about this story:
Frankenstein is unequivocally not an antiscience screed, and scientists and
engineers should not be afraid of it. The target of Mary’s literary insight is
not so much the content of Victor’s science as the way he pursues it. This
target is the same in much of science fiction—a genre that Mary certainly
helped to invent—especially the kind that takes a dystopian turn.4
 We can
choose to focus on the cautionary nature of the tale or on the part that
continues to inspire students who believe that they can do better—as
creative and responsible thinkers, makers, researchers, and citizens.
Since Mary’s day, science and technology have become more pervasive
in society. (We will demur from saying which society was changing faster,
Mary’s under steam power or ours under solar, nuclear, and computational power.) As we anticipate the third century beyond Mary’s vision, we
open the door to what may be the most pervasive scientific and technical
endeavors yet: the creation and design of living organisms through techniques of synthetic biology, the creation and design of planetary-scale systems through climate engineering, and the integration of computational
power and processes into nearly every sector of global society and even
the fibers of our being. These technologies, radically different from each
other in scale and materials, share a Promethean perspective. Each fuses
natural processes with updated human ingenuity and purpose to offer
much-needed benefits, but at the same time each presents real and even
existential risks that have roots in the long stream of previous iterations
of human ingenuity and purpose. Yet this framing of synthetic biology, climate engineering, and ubiquitous computation in terms of risk and benefit
conceals crucial questions of values and politics: Who gets to decide on
the agenda for scientific research and development? Who gets to say what
problems or grand challenges we try to solve? Who gets to say how we solve
them (or resolve them or muddle through them)? Who gets to partake in
those benefits, and are they the same people put at risk by our attempts to
solve the problems at stake?
These and many other questions are part of the enduring legacy of
Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, here brought to you in a new critical edition
designed to enhance our collective understandings and to invent—intentionally—a world in which we all want to live and, indeed, a world in which
we all can thrive.

NOTES
1. By “critical,” we mean being engaged in a detailed way with the text so that we are dealing not
with superficial appearances but rather with deeper meanings and understandings. Scholars in
the humanities often call this approach “close reading.” We do not mean “critical” in the sense of
“demeaning” or “disparaging.” In fact, for the style of critical engagement you will encounter in
this volume, simply attacking the novel or highlighting its flaws would not be nearly so revealing
or fun.
2. One contemporary source for this perspective is an episode of the cable television series Prophets
of Science Fiction (2011), dedicated to Mary Shelley and Frankenstein. The series was conceived,
hosted, and executive-produced by blockbuster science fiction film director Ridley Scott.
3. The challenges of understanding Mary Shelley across the centuries have been brought to life
brilliantly by a monologue commissioned and performed at the Bakken Museum. Located
in Minneapolis, the Bakken is a small museum dedicated to the history of research into electricity
and magnetism inspired by Earl Bakken, inventor of that most Frankensteinian technology,
the transistorized pacemaker. At the workshop in May 2014, we were treated to a performance of
this monologue by Dawn Krzykowski Brodey.
4. The relationship between science fiction and society’s broader relationship to the future is
central to the work that one of us (Finn) pursues at the Center for Science and the Imagination at
ASU. The center was founded to explore and expand our collective capacity to imagine a broad
range of possible futures, especially in terms of creativity and responsibility.

INTRODUCTION
CHARLES E. ROBINSON
In this novel written by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley (1797–1851), Victor
Frankenstein (never called “Dr.” Frankenstein) leaves behind his idyllic
childhood and Edenic Geneva, goes to university, studies the latest technologies and medical procedures, creates an unnamed monster,1
 and suffers
the dangerous consequences of his pursuit of knowledge when his creature destroys his brother William; his wife, Elizabeth; and his best friend,
Henry Clerval. In short, Frankenstein is a cautionary tale. And it is now
for the first time published by an institute of technology for the purposes
of educating students who are pursuing science, technology, engineering,
and mathematics (STEM). (Some readers may wish or need to substitute
medicine for mathematics in this acronym.) Up until this edition, Frankenstein has been primarily edited and published for and read by humanities
students, students equally in need of reading this cautionary tale about
forbidden knowledge and playing God. And to embrace the largest audience, we are publishing what may also be defined as a “STEAM edition” of
Frankenstein, the A edited in for the arts, design, and humanities.
STEAM provides us a launching point for an analysis of Frankenstein,
for its action takes place in the 1790s, by which time James Watt (1736–
1819) had radically improved the steam engine and in effect started the
Industrial Revolution, which accelerated the development of science and
technology as well as medicine and machines in the nineteenth century.2
The new steam engine powered paper mills, printed newspapers, and further developed commerce through steamboats and then trains. These same
years were charged by the French Revolution, and anyone wishing to do a
chronology of the action in Frankenstein will discover that Victor went off
to the University of Ingolstadt in 1789, the year of the Fall of the Bastille,
and he developed his creature in 1793, the year of the Reign of Terror in
France.3
 Terror (as well as error) was the child of both revolutions, and
Mary’s novel records the terrorizing effects of the birth of the new revolutionary age, in the shadows of which we still live.
Frankenstein presents us with a world full of shadows and darkness
and terror: we frequently read these three words and their variants in the
text of Frankenstein; we encounter the visuals of these three words in the
many hundreds of stage and screen adaptations of this novel, often figured
by the Boris Karloff neck-bolted monster; and we experience the shadows
and darkness and terror when we read the many news reports about cloning, genetic engineering, Frankenfoods, and the most recently unearthed
Frankenvirus announced in September 2015. All of these references derive
their metaphoric origin from a teenager named Mary Godwin, who eloped
to the Continent with the already married poet Percy Bysshe Shelley 
xxiv INTRODUCTION
(1792–1822) in late July 1814, when she was sixteen; began writing her
novel about Victor and his creature in Geneva in mid-June 1816, when she
was eighteen; married Percy in London in late December 1816 after his first
wife, Harriet, committed suicide; finished her novel in April or May 1817,
when she was nineteen; and published it on 1 January 1818, when she was
twenty years old. And this STEAM edition of the novel is being prepared
exactly two hundred years later in commemoration of the bicentennial of
this young woman’s achievements.
It needs to be firmly stated here that Mary was not a Luddite opposed
to new technologies. In fact, she was very interested in scientific matters,
probably as a consequence of her parents, Mary Wollstonecraft (1759–
1797) and William Godwin (1756–1836). Wollstonecraft was a famous
political philosopher and feminist who died eleven days after her daughter was born as Mary Godwin, but the daughter was nurtured by reading
her mother’s works, including Thoughts on the Education of Daughters
(1787) and the more famous Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792),
in which she argued that elementary school girls of the period should
perform the simple experiments in “natural philosophy” or science that
boys of the same age performed. Mary also received a scientific education
indirectly from her father, a famous novelist and political philosopher who
was visited at home by many famous writers and intellectuals, including
the scientist and inventor William Nicholson (1753–1815). As a young girl,
Mary almost certainly met Nicholson during his many visits to Godwin
up through February 1810, and she likely knew of his publications, which
included The First Principles of Chemistry (1790; third edition, 1796) and
his earlier student textbook Introduction to Natural Philosophy (2 vols.,
1782; fifth edition, 1805). As William St. Clair has remarked in his authoritative biography of the Godwins and the Shelleys, William Godwin turned
to Nicholson “for information on the latest theories in chemistry, physics,
optics, biology, and the other natural sciences” and for “his advice on scientific method” ([1989] 1991, 61).
When Mary met Percy Shelley, she learned that he had been encouraged in his scientific studies at Eton by Dr. James Lind (1736–1812), who
was a member of the Lunar Society, a club that included scientists such as
James Watt; the physician and poet and natural philosopher Erasmus
Darwin (1731–1802), who published Zoonomia (1794–1801), a medicalphilosophical treatise dealing with such matters as reproduction, development, sensation, and disease; and the dissenting minister and political
activist Joseph Priestley (1733–1804), who knew Benjamin Franklin and
published The History and Present State of Electricity, with Original 
INTRODUCTION xxv
Experiments (1767).4
 Mary also must have known that at Oxford in 1810–
1811 Percy had constructed his own electrical kite, made sparks by an electrical apparatus, and stored the “fluid” of electricity in Leyden jars: these
actions provide the basis for the electrical experiments by Victor’s father,
Alphonse, in Frankenstein. The two Shelleys attended at least one of the
many lectures in London on chemistry and electricity at this time, Mary
recording on 28 December 1814 that they attended the “Theatre of Grand
Philosophical Recreations” at the Great Room, Spring Gardens, where the
famous balloon ascender and parachute descender “Professor Garnerin”
gave a lecture titled “Electricity, Gas, Aerostation, Phantasmagoria, and
Hydraulic Sports.”5
 In Geneva in June 1816, during the coldest summer
on record, Mary listened to conversations between Lord Byron and Percy
about possibly discovering “the nature of the principle of life” (pp. 191–
192), about galvanism and the experiments of Erasmus Darwin, and about
the possible reanimation of a corpse.6
 And in early August 1816, she made
Percy a balloon and purchased a telescope for his birthday.7
 Within a few
months, by 28 October, she recorded her familiarity with the science of Sir
Humphry Davy (1778–1829), whose book Elements of Chemical Philosophy
(1812)8
 she read while she was drafting the first chapters of Frankenstein
in the fall of 1816.
During the two-year period before Mary began to write Frankenstein,
she was almost certainly aware, by way of Percy, of the famous vitalist
controversy on the definition of life between two prominent scientists,
John Abernethy (1764–1831) and his pupil, William Lawrence (1783–1867),
the two professors of anatomy and surgery at London’s Royal College of

 Percy had attended some of Abernethy’s lectures in 1811, and
Lawrence was Percy’s personal physician.10 Moreover, Mary had met
Lawrence at least twice when she accompanied her father to tea on 1
June 1812 and 5 March 1813 at the home of John Frank Newton, known
for his vegetarianism.11 Lawrence and Abernethy had become opponents
by 1814: the former argued for a materialist explanation of life and against
Abernethy’s theory of vitalism, which explained life in terms of “some
‘superadded’ force … , some ‘subtile, mobile, invisible substance,’ analogous on the one hand to soul and on the other to electricity.”12 This debate
between Lawrence and Abernethy may have inspired Mary’s depiction of
Victor’s relationships with his two different professors at the University
of Ingolstadt (1472–1800), an actual Bavarian institution that had faculties of science, humanities, and medicine.13 Victor first encountered and
rejected “M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy” (p. 28), who ridiculed
him for his concentration on the alchemical philosophers Albertus Magnus 
xxvi INTRODUCTION
(c. 1193–1280) and Paracelsus (1493–1541) and who recommended the
latest books on natural philosophy. Victor was not naive, but his negative
reaction to Krempe was dictated by the professor’s physiognomy (appearance is a thematic motif in this novel: witness the horrified reactions to
the deformed creature). As Victor himself explains, “I had long considered
those authors useless whom the professor had so strongly reprobated; but
I did not feel much inclined to study the books which I procured at his
recommendation. M. Krempe was a little squat man, with a gruff voice
and repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me
in favour of his doctrine. Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern
natural philosophy” (p. 29).
Victor changed his opinion about modern science once he heard M.
Waldman (also modeled on Percy Shelley’s kindly Etonian professor, Dr.
Lind) deliver a lecture about the history of science, a lecture that most
STEM students need to hear today:
M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very unlike his
colleague. He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an aspect
expressive of the greatest benevolence. … He began his lecture by a
recapitulation of the history of chemistry and the various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing with fervour
the names of the most distinguished discoverers. He then took a cursory
view of the present state of the science, and explained many of its
elementary terms. After having made a few preparatory experiments,
he concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of
which I shall never forget:—
“The ancient teachers of this science,” said he, “promised impossibilities, and performed nothing. The modern masters promise very little;
they know that metals cannot be transmuted, and that the elixir of life
is a chimera. But these philosophers, whose hands seem only made to
dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or crucible,
have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into the recesses of
nature, and shew how she works in her hiding places. They ascend
into the heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and
the nature of the air we breathe. They have acquired new and almost
unlimited powers; they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic
the earthquake, and even mock the invisible world with its own
shadows.” (p. 30)
That same evening Victor seeks out Waldman in his own house and discovers that his new mentor is exceptionally kind and affable:
INTRODUCTION xxvii
He heard with attention my little narration concerning my studies, and
smiled at the names of Cornelius Agrippa, and Paracelsus, but without
the contempt that M. Krempe had exhibited. He said, that “these were
men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted
for most of the foundations of their knowledge. They had left to us, as
an easier task, to give new names, and arrange in connected classifications, the facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments
of bringing to light. The labours of men of genius, however erroneously
directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage
of mankind.” … [I] added, that his lecture had removed my prejudices
against modern chemists; and I, at the same time, requested his advice
concerning the books I ought to procure. (pp. 30–31)
Before inviting Victor to use the machines in his laboratory, Waldman
gives him a message that speaks across the decades to the STEM students
of the twenty-first century:
“Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest
improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that
I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time I have not
neglected the other branches of science. A man would make but a very
sorry chemist, if he attended to that department of human knowledge
alone. If your wish is to become really a man of science, and not merely
a petty experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of
natural philosophy, including mathematics.” (p. 30)
Despite these endorsements of chemistry and natural philosophy in
her novel, Mary realized that science could be abused, as is certainly evident
in Victor’s reckless and selfish experiments, which do not account for their
consequences. Even Victor is aware of the distinction between his selfish
actions and his selfless actions. In his initial conversation with the scientific explorer Robert Walton, the narrator of this frame-tale novel,14 he
refuses to share his secret knowledge: “I will not lead you on, unguarded
and ardent as I then was, to your destruction and infallible misery.” Victor
continues: “Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example,
how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge, and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world, than he
who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow” (p. 35). On his
death bed at the end of the novel, Victor addresses a similar warning to
Walton: “Seek happiness in tranquillity, and avoid ambition, even if it be
only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in science and 
xxviii INTRODUCTION
discoveries. Yet why do I say this? I have myself been blasted in these hopes,
yet another may succeed” (p. 182).
Although Mary seems to be leaving the door open here for a future
when selflessness and science will mutually serve each other, the novel’s
basic argument is that science can be as destructive as it is constructive.
That argument about the dangers of knowledge is emphasized when the
creature “found a fire which had been left by some wandering beggars, and
was overcome with delight at the warmth I experienced from it. In my joy
I thrust my hand into the live embers, but quickly drew it out again with
a cry of pain. How strange, I thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects!” (p. 84, my italics).15 By her subtitle The Modern
Prometheus, Mary is asking her reader to recall the Promethean myth, in
which the Titan Prometheus steals fire (representing knowledge) from the
Olympian Zeus to give to primal and prerational man, only to suffer the
consequences of his actions. Zeus chains Prometheus, the creator of rational man, to a rock, where he is visited daily by a vulture/eagle that devours
his liver/heart, only to have the same punishment repeated each day. So
knowledge does cause sorrow, and fire does cause pain; and the etymology
of the name “Prometheus” (Forethought) is ironic: Victor, “the modern Prometheus,” lacks forethought and fails to understand the destructive consequences of his actions in constructing his creature. Although Mary did not
make the corollary myth explicit in her narrative, Prometheus’s brother
Epimetheus (Afterthought) is associated with all the evils released from
Pandora’s box: fulfilling that myth have been the technocratic decisions
leading to the pesticide DDT, the atom bomb, Three Mile Island, Chernobyl,
and the British government’s permission, reported in the British newspapers on 1 February 2016, that a stem cell scientist could perform genome
editing despite objections that ethical issues were being ignored.
Prometheus is not the only myth that Mary used to develop her theme.
Even more noticeable are her many references to the Book of Genesis, with
its Garden of Eden and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. The
epigraph on the title page of the first edition of Frankenstein in 1818 is
taken from John Milton’s famous epic poem Paradise Lost, one of the books
from which the creature learns to read. He is a “quick study” when he
reads that Adam and Eve, tempted by Satan to be like God in knowing
good and evil, ate of the tree and were exiled from paradise. Knowledge led
to sorrow and the fall of humankind from the sin of pride or hubris. The
attentive reader will notice that Victor’s Edenic childhood in Geneva is lost
when he goes off to university to study science: he laments the loss of his
“native town” (p. 53) in the same way that the creature laments his loss 
INTRODUCTION xxix
after he learns the “godlike science” of speech (p. 91) and “the science of
letters [reading]” (p. 97): “sorrow only increased with knowledge. Oh, that
I had for ever remained in my native wood, nor known or felt beyond the
sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!” (p. 99).16
The parallels between Victor’s and the creature’s statements about the
dangers of knowledge draw our attention to the doppelgänger or double
theme of this novel in which the physical ugliness of the creature reflects
the psychological ugliness of his creator, Victor. As Victor himself expresses
that relationship, “I considered the being whom I had cast among mankind,
and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror, such as
the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light of my own vampire,
my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was
dear to me” (p. 59). If man was made in God’s image, it is only appropriate that the creature would be made in the image of his psychologically
disfigured creator, one whose head or reason has destroyed his heart or
emotions in the persons of Elizabeth and Clerval: in the 1831 edition, Victor
identifies his Elizabeth as the “living spirit of love” that he needs for psychic
completion; and in both the 1818 and 1831 editions, Victor “saw the image
of [his] former [and better] self ” in Clerval (p. 134). A diagram helps to
demonstrate the symbolic relations among all of the major characters as
they externalize Victor’s internal conflict:
HEAD Robert Walton Victor Frankenstein the creature
HEART Margaret Walton Saville Elizabeth Lavenza and
Henry Clerval
the female creature
Once Victor destroys the female creature, it is inevitable that the creature
himself will destroy Elizabeth and Clerval; in effect, the novel “ends” the
night that Victor constructs his creature, and the rest of the plot merely literalizes and externalizes Victor’s self-destructive acts when he rules love
out of his heart and, in the form of his monstrous self, kills Elizabeth and
Clerval in what may be read as an act of suicide.
This reading of Frankenstein is but one among the many that this novel
allows. Victor constructing his monstrous creature may also be read as
political science or political philosophers creating the destructive French
Revolution or the science of natural philosophy creating the dehumanizing
Industrial Revolution. Yet another reading of the novel is that it is about
the creating of the novel itself: just as Victor assembles bones and muscles
and sinews and other body parts of his creature, so also Mary assembled 
xxx INTRODUCTION
the words and images and symbols and punctuation of her novel. To make
this point, she used birthing metaphors in her introduction to the 1831
edition: she did “dilate upon, so very hideous an idea”: “I bid my hideous
progeny go forth and prosper. I have an affection for it, for it was the
offspring of happy days” (pp. 189, 193, my italics).17
Those happy days involved collaboration with Percy Shelley in 1816
and 1817, when the novel was written—and there is a lesson to STEM
students in the facts of that collaboration, which is often essential for most
scientific discovery. As I have outlined in other publications,18 Percy edited
Mary’s novel, suggesting that she expand a shorter version of it into the
novel we now read, in the margins of the draft manuscript advising about
some of the plot, rewriting parts of the concluding pages as he fair copied
the draft into the pages that would be submitted to the publisher, advising
her about transforming her thirty-three-chapter draft into a twenty-threechapter “fair copy,” and writing at least five thousand of the seventy-two
thousand words of this novel. In general, Mary relied on Percy for some
of her accomplishments in the first edition of the novel she published on
1 January 1818.19 In doing so, she implicitly honored the character of
Clerval, who, as a social scientist and linguist staying in Geneva to honor
his father’s wishes and leaving there with the hopes of pursuing his own
education, only to end up nursing Victor, offers an example to the reader:
Clerval, whose “science” involves other people, does not isolate himself
as Victor does in his pursuit of knowledge. As Victor describes him later,
“Clerval! beloved friend! … He was a being formed in the ‘very poetry of
nature.’ His wild and enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart” (p. 132). It is likely that Percy wrote these words in a
late addition to the proofs of the novel, and the reference to “imagination”
(the head or reason chastened or directed by the heart) will help bring this
introduction to what I hope is an illuminating end.
The chastened or creative imagination is at the heart of English
romanticism, and its various definitions somehow involve or evolve from
the famous and short thirteenth chapter of Biographia literaria (1817) by
Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772–1834), in which he simply states that the
“primary imagination [is] the living power and prime agent of all human
perception, and … a repetition in the finite mind of the eternal act of
creation in the infinite I am” ([1817] 1907, 202). Just as God ontologically
created or fashioned this universe from chaotic matter, so also does the
human mind or imagination epistemologically creates its own universe
from the chaotic sensory data that a person receives from the external
world. Man is not God (although Victor tries to be); rather, man is like unto 
INTRODUCTION xxxi
God in each and every one of the creative perceptions that take place every
second of a human being’s existence. What this means is that we never
know the thing in itself—we know only our creative constructs of a thing.
Percy Shelley put it most bluntly: “nothing exists but as it is perceived,”
and “All things exist as they are perceived.”20 These statements mean that
for Percy Shelley, rather than an ontology (or theory of being) determining
what our epistemology (or theory of knowledge) might be, epistemology is
primary or privileged in all human experience. If creative perception determines existence, then it is fair to say that a novel is just as real or true as
a scientific theory—both are constructs by the human imagination to give
form to the chaos of our experiences. Such reasoning puts the A back into
STEM and demonstrates that there really are not Two Cultures, science
and the humanities21—there is only one unified theory of being created by
us as a means to give form to a reality that we never fully know in itself.
The Shelleys are attempting to tell us that the humanities, including in
this case Frankenstein, offer a representation of the world that is just as
valid as an engineer’s blueprint.
Thus, Frankenstein and this introduction encourage STEM students
to respect the humanities as offering a valid means of defining and even
improving the world, much as science hopes to do. Frankenstein is certainly
not the only work of art that addresses these issues, but it has become a
metaphor for science that ignores human consequences and values. Every
day some blog or newspaper or magazine or book or movie or television
show alludes to Frankenstein in order to describe science gone bad. But
these allusions to the evils of science can teach us much about our human
condition. In fact, some recent Frankenstein-inspired “moving pictures”
(the first Frankenstein film was produced in 1910 by the inventor Thomas
Edison) actually show a nonhuman being gaining respect for human life
and human values. Ignoring the usual suspects among the many “Frankenstein” movies, including Mel Brooks’s wonderful Young Frankenstein
(1974),22 I conclude here by mentioning two of my favorite allusive works
of art: James Cameron’s film Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) and the
CBS television series Person of Interest (2011–2016), which centers on an
artificial intelligence (AI) machine.
Most people do not realize that T-2 is an homage to Mary and her novel,
but the viewer is reminded of Frankenstein by the opening electric flashes
as the nonhuman android Arnold Schwarzenegger materializes, comes back
from the future, and reveals that he has apparently developed the equivalent of a heart that can feel for humanity. Even more allusive is his selfless
destruction of the computer chip that conveniently saves Los Angeles and 
xxxii INTRODUCTION
the world from the thermonuclear destruction that would occur on August
29, 1997, the day before Mary’s two hundredth birthday—so that we could
celebrate her bicentennial without holding her responsible for starting the
scientific revolution that eventually led to the computer chip that led to
the microprocessor that led to Skynet that led to the destruction of billions
of lives.
Less allusive but equally compelling is the plot of Person of Interest,
in which computer programmer, engineering genius, and tech billionaire
Harold Finch (he also goes by other bird names) creates an AI machine
for the government to prevent terrorist attacks. At the same time that the
government abuses the power of this all-seeing and all-hearing AI machine,
Finch and his associates use it to predict and prevent local murders and
other acts of nonterrorist violence. The amoral Machine, which electronically monitors every cell phone and email message and surveillance camera in the world to detect terrorism, teaches itself and apparently develops,
as the Terminator did, compassion for the local victims of violence. As it
is pursued by various antagonists and attacked by a competitor machine
called Samaritan, it hides itself in the national power grid. At the end of
season 4, as Samaritan shuts down the power grid starting on the West
Coast, the Machine retreats to a large electrical substation in Brooklyn
until Finch and associates download enough of the computer code into a
hard drive that will be carried away in a suitcase—in hopes of saving the
world from Samaritan’s machinations (as it were). Electricity, technology,
and the “Frankenstein” myth seem to come full circle at this moment of
the plot: from Benjamin Franklin’s kites and electrical storms to Joseph
Priestley’s history of electricity that led to late eighteenth-century and
early nineteenth-century scientific experiments, to Frankenstein, to Hollywood adaptations of Frankenstein that use lightning to power the electrical
machines that generate the creature, and to the most recent adaptations
that feature computers and codes and algorithms and hard drives and a
final apocalyptic machine on which the fate of the world depends.23

NOTES
1. In my previous publications on Frankenstein, I referred to Victor Frankenstein’s unnamed
creation as “the monster,” what I deemed the most appropriate of the names given to him
in the novel (he is also denominated “creature,” “Being,” “wretch,” “devil,” and “dæmon”). In this
introduction, I follow the editors’ use of the word creature to denominate the unnamed “Being,”
despite the fact that some who use the word creature tend to excuse his actions, whereas
some who use the word monster tend to hold him accountable for the murders he commits.
Mary certainly wanted to force the reader to morally judge the “creature” by not giving him a name. 
INTRODUCTION xxxiii
For example, were we to call him a “dæmon,” we would not necessarily demonize him, for “dæmon”
to Mary meant not a devil (and not a program running in a Unix system) but, as in Greek mythology,
a runner between heaven and earth, a superhuman being less than a god. By having no single
name, the monster has a universality that embraces all of humankind; indeed, when Mary saw in
the playbill of the first theatrical performance of her novel in 1823 that the “______” was being
played by “Mr T. Cooke,” she remarked in a letter to Leigh Hunt that “this nameless mode of naming
the un[n]ameable is rather good” (M. Shelley 1980, 1:378). The reader is also reminded that
“naming” is a symbolic act in which the namer is greater than the named; that Victor does not name
his “creature” tells us much about their relationship.

Garnerin (1769–1823), but it also might possibly be his brother Jean-Baptiste-Olivier Garnerin
(1766–1849). Because of a misreading of Mary’s journal entry, the lecturer is incorrectly identified
as Andrew Crosse in scores of websites and a number of books—see, for example, Prior 2015.
(Note that difficult-to-correct error creeps into literary as well as scientific papers.) It is also
possible that the lectures to which Godwin took Mary in early 1812 (January 2, 9, 13, 16, 20, and
27), as recorded in his diary, dealt with anatomy and chemistry—see Godwin 2012 and http://

Villa Diodati were Mary and Percy, the twenty-eight-year-old poet Lord Byron (1788–1824);

(1798–1879), pregnant with Byron’s child; and Byron’s young personal physician, John William

xxxiv INTRODUCTION
13. The University of Ingolstadt was also defined by the Illuminati, a secret and revolutionary
society founded there in 1776.
14. The frame tale is essentially a didactic device: from the outside in, the reader is to Walton just
as Walton is to Victor just as Victor is to the creature just as the creature is to the De Laceys.
From the inside out, the De Laceys teach the creature, who teaches Victor, who teaches Walton,
who teaches his sister, Margaret Walton Saville (note the initials MWS), and thereby teaches
the reader about the dangerous consequences of the pursuit of knowledge.
15. Mary makes the same symbolic point when the creature delivers firewood to assist the De
Lacey family with their chores but then later burns down the De Lacey cottage after the family
rejects him.
16. The third Western myth about the dangerous consequences of the pursuit of knowledge can
be found in Plato’s Symposium (Plato 1999), in which Aristophanes, in attempting to define love,
tells the story of the circular and sexually complete (four arms and four legs) primal being who
rolls halfway up Mount Olympus and with the extra appendages scales the remaining heights and
intrudes on the dominion of the gods. In response to that being’s presumption and pride, the gods
split the being down the middle. Aristophanes concludes that love is the desire to make whole,
complete, and entire what once had been whole, complete, and entire. Mary does not allude to this
myth until her 1831 edition, in which Victor tells Walton that “we are unfashioned creatures, but
half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves—such a friend ought to be—do not lend
his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I once had a friend [Clerval], the most noble
of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting friendship” ([1831] 2000, 38).
Mary became aware of this myth when she, as amanuensis, transcribed Percy’s translation of the
Symposium in 1818.
17. For one of the many birthing metaphors in the novel proper, consider that Frankenstein’s
“cheek had grown pale with study, and [his] person had become emaciated with confinement”
(p. 38) during the period he constructs his creature, “confinement” denoting the period shortly
before the birth of a child. For another reference to this metaphor, consider that Walton’s narrative
takes place over 276 days—that is, the nine-month gestation period.
18. See my “Frankenstein Chronology” (Robinson 2016a, 1:lxxvi–cx), especially the entries
between 15 June 1816 and 28 October 1817; this chronology can be consulted online in the

Mavor, & Jones. A second edition in two volumes was published on 11 August 1823 in 500 copies
by G. and W. B. Whittaker. A revised and third edition in one volume with an added chapter was

INTRODUCTION xxxv
23. In the final episode of season 5 of Person of Interest, which aired on CBS on 21 June 2016,
we encounter an Ice-9 computer virus that eventually destroys Samaritan and nearly destroys
the Machine; a “cyber apocalypse” survived by the Machine and Finch and some of his associates;
and two universal lessons voiced by the Machine that Finch created: “everyone dies alone,” but
“maybe you never really die.” Although Frankenstein is never directly invoked in any of the 103
episodes, Person of Interest testifies to the life of Mary Shelley and of her creature during the past
two hundred years.


VOL. I
PREFACE
The event on which this fiction is founded has been supposed, by Dr. Darwin,1
and some of the physiological writers of Germany, as not of impossible occurrence. I shall not be supposed as according the remotest degree of serious
faith to such an imagination; yet, in assuming it as the basis of a work of
fancy, I have not considered myself as merely weaving a series of supernatural terrors. The event on which the interest of the story depends is
exempt from the disadvantages of a mere tale of spectres or enchantment.
It was recommended by the novelty of the situations which it developes;
and, however impossible as a physical fact, affords a point of view to the
imagination for the delineating of human passions more comprehensive
and commanding than any which the ordinary relations of existing events
can yield.
I have thus endeavoured to preserve the truth of the elementary principles of human nature, while I have not scrupled to innovate upon their
combinations. The Iliad, the tragic poetry of Greece,—Shakespeare, in the
Tempest and Midsummer Night’s Dream,—and most especially Milton, in
Paradise Lost, conform to this rule; and the most humble novelist, who
seeks to confer or receive amusement from his labours, may, without
presumption, apply to prose fiction a licence, or rather a rule, from the
adoption of which so many exquisite combinations of human feeling have
resulted in the highest specimens of poetry.
The circumstance on which my story rests was suggested in casual
conversation. It was commenced, partly as a source of amusement, and
partly as an expedient for exercising any untried resources of mind. Other
motives were mingled with these, as the work proceeded. I am by no means
indifferent to the manner in which whatever moral tendencies exist in the
sentiments or characters it contains shall affect the reader; yet my chief
concern in this respect has been limited to the avoiding the enervating
effects of the novels of the present day, and to the exhibition of the amiableness of domestic affection, and the excellence of universal virtue. The
opinions which naturally spring from the character and situation of the
hero are by no means to be conceived as existing always in my own conviction; nor is any inference justly to be drawn from the following pages as
prejudicing any philosophical doctrine of whatever kind.
1. Erasmus Darwin (1731–1802), a friend of Mary’s father, William Godwin, was a physician,
naturalist, philosopher, and poet. He contributed an early formulation of a single origin for all life,
which undergirded what came to be known as the theory of evolution as elaborated by his
grandson, Charles Darwin.

2 FRANKENSTEIN
It is a subject also of additional interest to the author, that this story
was begun in the majestic region where the scene is principally laid, and in
society which cannot cease to be regretted. I passed the summer of 1816 in
the environs of Geneva. The season was cold and rainy, and in the evenings
we crowded around a blazing wood fire, and occasionally amused ourselves
with some German stories of ghosts, which happened to fall into our hands.
These tales excited in us a playful desire of imitation. Two other friends (a
tale from the pen of one of whom would be far more acceptable to the public
than any thing I can ever hope to produce) and myself agreed to write each
a story, founded on some supernatural occurrence.
The weather, however, suddenly became serene; and my two friends
left me on a journey among the Alps, and lost, in the magnificent scenes
which they present, all memory of their ghostly visions. The following tale
is the only one which has been completed.2
LETTER I.
To Mrs. SAVILLE, England.
St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17—.
You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commencement
of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings. I
arrived here yesterday; and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my
welfare, and increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking.
I am already far north of London; and as I walk in the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which braces my
nerves, and fills me with delight. Do you understand this feeling? This
breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes. Inspirited by this wind of
promise, my day dreams become more fervent and vivid. I try in vain to be
persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation; it ever presents
itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight. There,
Margaret, the sun is for ever visible; its broad disk just skirting the horizon,
and diffusing a perpetual splendour. There—for with your leave, my sister,
2. Lord George Gordon Byron (1788–1824) answered his own challenge that evening by writing
the first paragraph of a vampire story inspired by the German ghost stories. John Polidori
(1795–1821) later extended that beginning into “The Vampyre” (1819), a short story that went on
to inspire Bram Stoker’s tremendously successful novel Dracula in 1897.

I will put some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are
banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the
habitable globe. Its productions and features may be without example, as
the phænomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light?
I may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle;3
 and
may regulate a thousand celestial observations, that require only this
voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I shall
satiate my ardent curiosity 4
 with the sight of a part of the world never
3. When Captain Walton talks about the “wondrous power [of] the needle,” he talks about magnetism and its very first application in a compass. For centuries, people ascribed magical powers
to magnetite and lodestones, until William Gilbert (1540–1603) first discovered the basic features
of magnetism and the fact that Earth itself is a weak magnet. The links between electricity and
magnetism were a major subject of scientific investigation during Mary’s lifetime, and a number of
expeditions departed for the North and South Poles in the hopes of discovering the secrets of
the planet’s magnetic field.

4. For moderns, this comment may seem self-evident, if a little florid. But such Promethean ambition does not characterize all historical periods or all cultures or all individuals; rather, it reflects
the interesting combination of curiosity, ambition, and historical perspective that coevolved with
the European exploration of science and a profoundly multicultural world. Mary was writing at
the close of the Age of Discovery, during which Europeans rounded the southern tip of Africa,
“discovered” and colonized the New World, and circumnavigated the globe. Polar exploration was
one remaining feat. It was also the age of romanticism, the paintings of Caspar David Friedrich
(1774–1840) and Eugène Delacroix (1798–1863), as well as the music of Ludwig van Beethoven
(1770–1827) and Hector Berlioz (1803–1869). This eagerness for exploration is express in
“Ulysses,” the poem written in 1833 by Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–1892):
I cannot rest from travel: I will drink
Life to the lees: All times I have enjoy’d
Greatly, have suffer’d greatly, both with those
That loved me, and alone, on shore, and when
Thro’ scudding drifts the rainy Hyades
Vext the dim sea: I am become a name;
For always roaming with a hungry heart.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I am a part of all that I have met;
Yet all experience is an arch wherethro’
Gleams that untravell’d world whose margin fades
For ever and forever when I move. (Tennyson 2004, 49)
The irony, at least to modern sensibilities, is that this romantic language befits the pursuit of art,
not the rational pursuit of science.

before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of
man.5
 These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear
of danger or death, and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage
with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday
mates, on an expedition of discovery up his native river. But, supposing all
these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the inestimable benefit
which I shall confer on all mankind to the last generation, by discovering a
passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present so many
months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if
at all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.
These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my
letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me
to heaven; for nothing contributes so much to tranquillize the mind as
a steady purpose,—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye.
This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I have
read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been
made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean through the
seas which surround the pole. You may remember, that a history of all the
voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good
uncle Thomas’s library. My education was neglected, yet I was passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study day and night, and my
familiarity with them increased that regret which I had felt, as a child, on
learning that my father’s dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow
me to embark in a sea-faring life.
5. The phrase manifest destiny emerged in nineteenth-century America. It described the notion that
the expansion of the American people, culture, and institutions across North America was a mission of divine Providence, not merely one driven by practical need for more land and resources. But
the concept is much more deeply rooted and widespread, appearing in the earliest Western writings
in the form of the Promised Land of Abraham and his Israelite descendants. Robert Walton invokes
the concept implicitly in his exploration, which seems to need no justification other than that it
might help him to “accomplish some great purpose” (p. 5). By the nineteenth century, the development of science and industry not only facilitated such explorations but also made the conquest of
knowledge itself into a frontier that began to rival the conquest of land in importance—and that
was similarly justified in terms of a manifest destiny. The story of Frankenstein mirrors this transformation as Walton’s determination to visit that which has never before been visited is juxtaposed
alongside Victor’s determination to do that which has never before been done. We often use the
metaphor of the frontier—for example, “frontiers of research”—in describing the reach of scientific
inquiry. Worried that the American westward expansion and the manifest destiny that fueled it had
run its course, MIT engineer and presidential adviser Vannevar Bush (1945) coined the phrase the
endless frontier for the title of a report issued to President Harry Truman toward the end of World
War II. The report advocated for continued strong support of scientific research by the federal government after the war ended because scientific research could provide the inspiration and economic
benefits that westward expansion had previously provided.

Volume I 5
These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets
whose effusions entranced my soul, and lifted it to heaven. I also became
a poet, and for one year lived in a Paradise of my own creation; I imagined
that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of Homer
and Shakespeare are consecrated. You are well acquainted with my failure, and how heavily I bore the disappointment. But just at that time I
inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my thoughts were turned into the
channel of their earlier bent.
Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I
can, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this
great enterprise. I commenced by inuring my body to hardship. I accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea; I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often worked
harder than the common sailors during the day, and devoted my nights to
the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those branches of
physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest
practical advantage. Twice I actually hired myself as an under-mate in a
Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I must own I felt a
little proud, when my captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel,
and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness; so valuable did
he consider my services.
And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great
purpose. My life might have been passed in ease and luxury; but I preferred glory to every enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that
some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative! My courage and
my resolution is firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often
depressed. I am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage; the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to
raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when their’s
are failing.
This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly
quickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in my
opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stage-coach. The cold
is not excessive, if you are wrapt in furs, a dress which I have already
adopted; for there is a great difference between walking the deck and
remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise prevents the
blood from actually freezing in your veins. I have no ambition to lose my
life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel.
6 FRANKENSTEIN
I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my
intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the
insurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend
to sail until the month of June: and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister,
how can I answer this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps
years, will pass before you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again
soon, or never.
Farewell, my dear, excellent, Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on you, and save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude
for all your love and kindness.
Your affectionate brother,
R. WALTON.
LETTER II.
To Mrs. SAVILLE, England.
Archangel, 28th March, 17—.
How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow;
yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a vessel, and
am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have already engaged
appear to be men on whom I can depend, and are certainly possessed of
dauntless courage.
But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy; and
the absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil. I have
no friend,6
 Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success,
there will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit
my thoughts to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling. I desire the company of a man who could sympathize
6. Throughout the novel, the problem of companionship recurs for Walton, for Victor, and for
Victor’s creature. Friendship is one of the foundations for community because it connects
the individual to a larger human endeavor—be it society, government, or scientific exploration.
The novel explores the value of trust and camaraderie wherein one can divulge deep concerns,
passions, and ambitions with another and so gain another’s insight into one’s own perspective.
Throughout the novel, the failure to connect with a friend becomes a problem with serious
consequences. Mary rarely has such companionship except, perhaps, with Percy Shelley. Percy’s
friendship with Lord Byron is well documented and acclaimed as an example of romantic poets
and thinkers who shared ideas and artistic passion.

Volume I 7
with me; whose eyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my
dear sister, but I bitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me,
gentle yet courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious
mind, whose tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How
would such a friend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent
in execution, and too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil
to me that I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran
wild on a common, and read nothing but our uncle Thomas’s books of voyages. At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own
country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive
its most important benefits from such a conviction, that I perceived the
necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my
native country. Now I am twenty-eight, and am in reality more illiterate
than many school-boys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more, and
that my day dreams are more extended and magnificent; but they want (as
the painters call it) keeping; and I greatly need a friend who would have
sense enough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me
to endeavour to regulate my mind.
Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on
the wide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even
in these rugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful
courage and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory. He is an Englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices, unsoftened
by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity. I first
became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel: finding that he was
unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise.
The master is a person of an excellent disposition, and is remarkable in
the ship for his gentleness, and the mildness of his discipline. He is, indeed,
of so amiable a nature, that he will not hunt (a favourite, and almost the
only amusement here), because he cannot endure to spill blood. He is, moreover, heroically generous. Some years ago he loved a young Russian lady, of
moderate fortune; and having amassed a considerable sum in prize-money,
the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw his mistress once
before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in tears, and, throwing
herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the same time
that she loved another, but that he was poor, and that her father would
never consent to the union. My generous friend reassured the suppliant,
and on being informed of the name of her lover instantly abandoned his
pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his money, on which he had 
8 FRANKENSTEIN
designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he bestowed the whole on
his rival, together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase stock,
and then himself solicited the young woman’s father to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old man decidedly refused, thinking himself
bound in honour to my friend; who, when he found the father inexorable,
quitted his country, nor returned until he heard that his former mistress
was married according to her inclinations. “What a noble fellow!”7
 you will
exclaim. He is so; but then he has passed all his life on board a vessel, and
has scarcely an idea beyond the rope and the shroud.
But do not suppose that, because I complain a little, or because I can
conceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am
wavering in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate; and my voyage is
only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. The
winter has been dreadfully severe; but the spring promises well, and it
is considered as a remarkably early season; so that, perhaps, I may sail
sooner than I expected. I shall do nothing rashly; you know me sufficiently
to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the safety of others
is committed to my care.
I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my
undertaking. It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the
trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which I am
preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions, to “the land of mist
and snow”; but I shall kill no albatross,8
 therefore do not be alarmed for
my safety.
7. There are two meanings to the word nobility, and they are often conflated. The first refers to
possessing a character with the highest qualities found in human beings, such as integrity,
decency, honor, and goodness. But these qualities are often attributed to persons of the highest
social rank in society—the second meaning of the word. The lieutenant, who gives up the woman
he is engaged to when she says she loves another and generously provides her lover with the
financial means to gain the acceptance of her family, goes well beyond what is expected. Perhaps
this behavior earns him the exclamation point? Mary gives these noble qualities to Walton’s second
in command, perhaps challenging the taken-for-granted hierarchy that typically ascribed these
qualities to individuals at the top. Yet she qualifies this choice by stating that the lieutenant didn’t
know any better, given that he spent so much time aboard a ship, further hinting that in the end
his sacrifice was no great loss to him. In real life, Mary marries into a noble family that opposes
her union with their son because of her father’s indebtedness.
Mary Margaret Fonow.
8. Mary has Captain Walton allude to the poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner (1798), written by
Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772–1834). In the poem, which Mary heard Coleridge reading during
his many visits to the Godwin house, the title character kills an albatross that has been following
his boat, turning a good luck sign into an ill omen.

LETTER III.
To Mrs. SAVILLE, England.
July 7th, 17—.
MY DEAR SISTER,
I write a few lines in haste, to say that I am safe, and well advanced on
my voyage. This letter will reach England by a merchant-man now on its
homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not see
my native land, perhaps, for many years. I am, however, in good spirits: my
men are bold, and apparently firm of purpose; nor do the floating sheets of
ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers of the region towards
which we are advancing, appear to dismay them. We have already reached
a very high latitude; but it is the height of summer, and although not so
warm as in England, the southern gales, which blow us speedily towards
those shores which I so ardently desire to attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not expected.
No incidents have hitherto befallen us, that would make a figure in
a letter. One or two stiff gales, and the breaking of a mast, are accidents
which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record; and I shall be
well content, if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.
Adieu, my dear Margaret. Be assured, that for my own sake, as well as
your’s, I will not rashly encounter danger. I will be cool, persevering, and
prudent.
Remember me to all my English friends.9
Most affectionately yours,
R. W.

are made up of letters exchanged among the characters. These letters are often long and tender,
and they contain a wealth of personal details and endearments that do little to move the plot forward.

LETTER IV.
To Mrs. SAVILLE, England.
August 5th, 17—.
So strange an accident has happened to us, that I cannot forbear recording
it, although it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can
come into your possession.
Last Monday (July 31st), we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed
in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea room in which she floated.
Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we were compassed
round by a very thick fog. We accordingly lay to, hoping that some change
would take place in the atmosphere and weather.
About two o’clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out
in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to have
no end. Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to grow
watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly attracted
our attention, and diverted our solicitude from our own situation. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs, pass on towards
the north, at the distance of half a mile: a being which had the shape of a
man, but apparently of gigantic stature, sat in the sledge, and guided the
dogs. We watched the rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes,
until he was lost among the distant inequalities of the ice.
This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we believed,
many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote
that it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however,
This approach might seem like an inefficient storytelling strategy, but it is quite the opposite. Mary
uses these letters strategically to emphasize the importance of the social bonds that give characters such as Victor and Captain Walton emotional sustenance during incredibly stressful times.
The letters are tangible artifacts of emotional labor—the investments of time, wit, and emotional
energy that make human relationships functional and rewarding. They contrast with the creature’s
life and reveal precisely what he is missing. He has no one with whom to share his experiences
and frustrations, so his life becomes unbearable, and he lashes out violently.
Language is an important way that we show love and understanding as well as receive it. The
laborious, solitary way that the creature acquires language, through scavenging books and eavesdropping, demonstrates just how removed he is from any form of nurturing social interaction.
Walton narrowly avoids making the same mistake as Victor, pursuing scientific discovery without considering the safety and well-being of the people around him. Walton is luckily in continuous
written contact with his sister, Margaret, who lovingly discourages him from going through
with his expedition to the North Pole. Their conversation, conducted through a series of letters,
might be what saves his life and the lives of his crew.

Volume I 11
by ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with
the greatest attention.
About two hours after this occurrence, we heard the ground sea; and
before night the ice broke, and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the
morning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which
float about after the breaking up of the ice. I profited of this time to rest
for a few hours.
In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck, and
found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently talking to
some one in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we had seen before,
which had drifted towards us in the night, on a large fragment of ice. Only
one dog remained alive; but there was a human being within it, whom the
sailors were persuading to enter the vessel. He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island, but an
European. When I appeared on deck, the master said, “Here is our captain,
and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea.”
On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with
a foreign accent. “Before I come on board your vessel,” said he, “will you have
the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?”
You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction, and to whom I should
have supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would
not have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford. I
replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the northern pole.
Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied, and consented to come on
board. Good God! Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated
for his safety, your surprise would have been boundless. His limbs were
nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering.
I never saw a man in so wretched a condition. We attempted to carry him
into the cabin; but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air, he fainted. We
accordingly brought him back to the deck, and restored him to animation
by rubbing him with brandy, and forcing him to swallow a small quantity. As
soon as he shewed signs of life, we wrapped him up in blankets, and placed
him near the chimney of the kitchen-stove. By slow degrees he recovered,
and ate a little soup, which restored him wonderfully.
Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak; and I
often feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding. When
he had in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin, and
attended on him as much as my duty would permit. I never saw a more 
12 FRANKENSTEIN
interesting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of wildness,
and even madness; but there are moments when, if any one performs an
act of kindness towards him, or does him any the most trifling service, his
whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a beam of benevolence
and sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he is generally melancholy
and despairing; and sometimes he gnashes his teeth, as if impatient of the
weight of woes that oppresses him.
When my guest was a little recovered, I had great trouble to keep off
the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not
allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body and
mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose. Once,
however, the lieutenant asked, Why he had come so far upon the ice in so
strange a vehicle?
His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom;
and he replied, “To seek one who fled from me.”
“And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?”
“Yes.”
“Then I fancy we have seen him; for, the day before we picked you up,
we saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.”
This aroused the stranger’s attention; and he asked a multitude of
questions concerning the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had
pursued. Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, “I have, doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good people; but you are
too considerate to make inquiries.”
“Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to
trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.”
“And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you
have benevolently restored me to life.”
Soon after this he inquired, if I thought that the breaking up of the ice
had destroyed the other sledge? I replied, that I could not answer with any
degree of certainty; for the ice had not broken until near midnight, and the
traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that time; but of
this I could not judge.
From this time the stranger seemed very eager to be upon deck, to
watch for the sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him
to remain in the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the
atmosphere. But I have promised that some one should watch for him, and
give him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight.
Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to
the present day. The stranger has gradually improved in health, but is 
Volume I 13
very silent, and appears uneasy when any one except myself enters his
cabin. Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle, that the sailors are
all interested in him, although they have had very little communication
with him. For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother; and his constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion. He must have
been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck so attractive and amiable.10
I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no
friend on the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had
been broken by misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as the
brother of my heart.
I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals, should
I have any fresh incidents to record.
August 13th, 17—.
My affection for my guest increases every day. He excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see so noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief? He is so
gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated; and when he speaks, although
his words are culled with the choicest art, yet they flow with rapidity and
unparalleled eloquence.
He is now much recovered from his illness, and is continually on the
deck, apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although
unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery, but that he
interests himself deeply in the employments of others. He has asked me
many questions concerning my design; and I have related my little history
frankly to him. He appeared pleased with the confidence, and suggested
several alterations in my plan, which I shall find exceedingly useful.
There is no pedantry in his manner; but all he does appears to spring
solely from the interest he instinctively takes in the welfare of those
who surround him. He is often overcome by gloom, and then he sits by
himself, and tries to overcome all that is sullen or unsocial in his humour.
10. This is how Victor appears to the leader of the rescuing ship, Captain Robert Walton, though
Walton knows only that Victor is European and not comparable to the seemingly “savage”
(p. 11) creature he is chasing. Even in his much diminished state, Victor’s noble qualities are
apparent. Victor might become the noble friend Walton so longs for, someone of equal status who
understands him and can provide wise counsel. Mary attributes both noble and not-so-noble
qualities to Victor, but Walton will need to hear the full story before the complexities of Victor’s
character are revealed.
Mary Margaret Fonow.
14 FRANKENSTEIN
These paroxysms pass from him like a cloud from before the sun, though
his dejection never leaves him. I have endeavoured to win his confidence;
and I trust that I have succeeded. One day I mentioned to him the desire
I had always felt of finding a friend who might sympathize with me, and
direct me by his counsel. I said, I did not belong to that class of men who
are offended by advice. “I am self-educated, and perhaps I hardly rely sufficiently upon my own powers. I wish therefore that my companion should
be wiser and more experienced than myself, to confirm and support me;
nor have I believed it impossible to find a true friend.”11
“I agree with you,” replied the stranger, “in believing that friendship is
not only a desirable, but a possible acquisition. I once had a friend, the most
noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting
friendship. You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for
despair. But I——I have lost every thing, and cannot begin life anew.”
As he said this, his countenance became expressive of a calm settled
grief, that touched me to the heart. But he was silent, and presently retired
to his cabin.
Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does
the beauties of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every sight afforded
by these wonderful regions, seems still to have the power of elevating his

of my cousin” (p. 4). The knowledge gained from understanding his own initial conditions may have
inspired Walton’s decision to set challenging goals for himself. He seems to have worked hard at
addressing some of his educational shortcomings as well as his limited perspective on hard work
and hardship. Albert Bandura reminds us that “people motivate and guide their actions by setting
themselves challenging goals and then mobilizing their skills and effort to reach them. After people
attain the goal they have been pursuing, those with a strong sense of efficacy set higher goals
for themselves” (1994, 265). Walton does not appear to be an exception. His intellectual isolation
grows during this fateful voyage, with the need for finding a wiser, highly experienced, caring
“companion” becoming of paramount importance. His cry for intellectual companionship, a mentor
or mentors, is rewarded in two ways, with approval and intimacy. The value that Walton places
on approval is rather telling: “I must own I felt a little proud, when my captain offered me the
second dignity in the vessel, and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness; so valuable
did he consider my services” (p. 5). However, it is the arrival of an educated, enigmatic stranger
that brings forward the excitement that Walton places on intellectual companionship (mentor–
mentee dynamics): he worries that he “should find no friend on the wide ocean; yet I have found
a man … so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated; and when he speaks, although his words
are culled with the choicest art, yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence” (p. 13).
Walton finds a “true friend,” an intellectual companion, a great mentor, a divine wanderer “a celestial
spirit, that has a halo around him” (p. 15).

soul from earth. Such a man has a double existence: he may suffer misery,
and be overwhelmed by disappointments; yet when he has retired into
himself, he will be like a celestial spirit, that has a halo around him, within
whose circle no grief or folly ventures.
Will you laugh at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine wanderer? If you do, you must have certainly lost that simplicity which was
once your characteristic charm. Yet, if you will, smile at the warmth of my
expressions, while I find every day new causes for repeating them.
August 19th, 17—.
Yesterday the stranger said to me, “You may easily perceive, Captain Walton,
that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. I had determined,
once, that the memory of these evils should die with me; but you have won
me to alter my determination. You seek for knowledge and wisdom, as I
once did; and I ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not
be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been.12 I do not know that the relation of my misfortunes will be useful to you, yet, if you are inclined, listen
to my tale. I believe that the strange incidents connected with it will afford
a view of nature, which may enlarge your faculties and understanding. You
will hear of powers and occurrences, such as you have been accustomed
to believe impossible: but I do not doubt that my tale conveys in its series
internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed.”
You may easily conceive that I was much gratified by the offered communication; yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital
of his misfortunes. I felt the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative, partly from curiosity, and partly from a strong desire to ameliorate
his fate, if it were in my power. I expressed these feelings in my answer.
“I thank you,” he replied, “for your sympathy, but it is useless; my fate is
nearly fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and then I shall repose in peace.
I understand your feeling,” continued he, perceiving that I wished to interrupt him; “but you are mistaken, my friend, if thus you will allow me to
name you; nothing can alter my destiny: listen to my history, and you will
perceive how irrevocably it is determined.”

that he recognizes his paternity of the creature, but, like Lear, he still does not recognize his
own full measure of culpability and responsibility.

13. The setting for the story is Geneva, Switzerland, one of the oldest major capitals of Europe,
and Victor is from one of its noblest families. He uses his scientific training to create a new life
but then fails to take responsibility for loving and caring for that life. He is shocked and disgusted
when his creation doesn’t turn out as he planned. Yet he is also mostly unaware that his failure
to take care of his creation in turn has created the creature he fears and rejects. Mary and her
family traveled in more liberal and even radical circles, and she abhorred and flaunted the conventional mores of high society. In Frankenstein, is she calling attention to the propensity of those
at the top to ignore the consequences of their actions? Social status cannot fully protect individuals
from unintended consequences. Scientists and engineers who are often at the highest ranks of
the academy need to be more mindful of the unintended consequences of their discoveries.

He then told me, that he would commence his narrative the next day
when I should be at leisure. This promise drew from me the warmest
thanks. I have resolved every night, when I am not engaged, to record, as
nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during the day. If
I should be engaged, I will at least make notes. This manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure: but to me, who know him, and who
hear it from his own lips, with what interest and sympathy shall I read it
in some future day!
FRANKENSTEIN;
OR, THE MODERN PROMETHEUS.
CHAPTER I.
I am by birth a Genevese; and my family is one of the most distinguished
of that republic.13 My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and
syndics; and my father had filled several public situations with honour
and reputation. He was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and
indefatigable attention to public business. He passed his younger days
perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country; and it was not until the
decline of life that he thought of marrying, and bestowing on the state sons
who might carry his virtues and his name down to posterity.
Volume I 17
As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot
refrain from relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a merchant, who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous mischances,
into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a proud and
unbending disposition, and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in
the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank
and magnificence. Having paid his debts, therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his daughter to the town of Lucerne, where
he lived unknown and in wretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the
truest friendship, and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances. He grieved also for the loss of his society, and resolved
to seek him out and endeavour to persuade him to begin the world again
through his credit and assistance.
Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself; and it was
ten months before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery, he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street,
near the Reuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed
him. Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck
of his fortunes; but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for
some months, and in the mean time he hoped to procure some respectable
employment in a merchant’s house. The interval was consequently spent
in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling, when he had leisure for reflection; and at length it took so fast hold of his mind, that at the
end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.
His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness; but she saw
with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing, and that there
was no other prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind
of an uncommon mould; and her courage rose to support her in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw; and by various means
contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life.
Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her
time was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving her an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her; and she knelt
by Beaufort’s coffin, weeping bitterly, when my father entered the chamber.
He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who committed herself to
his care, and after the interment of his friend he conducted her to Geneva,
and placed her under the protection of a relation. Two years after this
event Caroline became his wife.
18 FRANKENSTEIN
When my father became a husband and a parent, he found his time so
occupied by the duties of his new situation, that he relinquished many of
his public employments, and devoted himself to the education of his children. Of these I was the eldest, and the destined successor to all his labours
and utility. No creature could have more tender parents than mine. My
improvement and health were their constant care, especially as I remained
for several years their only child. But before I continue my narrative, I
must record an incident which took place when I was four years of age.
My father had a sister, whom he tenderly loved, and who had married early in life an Italian gentleman. Soon after her marriage, she had
accompanied her husband into his native country, and for some years my
father had very little communication with her. About the time I mentioned
she died; and a few months afterwards he received a letter from her husband, acquainting him with his intention of marrying an Italian lady, and
requesting my father to take charge of the infant Elizabeth, the only child
of his deceased sister. “It is my wish,” he said, “that you should consider
her as your own daughter, and educate her thus. Her mother’s fortune
is secured to her, the documents of which I will commit to your keeping.
Reflect upon this proposition; and decide whether you would prefer educating your niece yourself to her being brought up by a stepmother.”
My father did not hesitate, and immediately went to Italy, that he
might accompany the little Elizabeth to her future home. I have often
heard my mother say, that she was at that time the most beautiful child
she had ever seen, and shewed signs even then of a gentle and affectionate
disposition. These indications, and a desire to bind as closely as possible
the ties of domestic love, determined my mother to consider Elizabeth as
my future wife; a design which she never found reason to repent.
From this time Elizabeth Lavenza became my playfellow, and, as we
grew older, my friend. She was docile and good tempered, yet gay and playful as a summer insect. Although she was lively and animated, her feelings
were strong and deep, and her disposition uncommonly affectionate. No
one could better enjoy liberty, yet no one could submit with more grace
than she did to constraint and caprice. Her imagination was luxuriant, yet
her capability of application was great. Her person was the image of her
mind; her hazel eyes, although as lively as a bird’s, possessed an attractive
softness. Her figure was light and airy; and, though capable of enduring
great fatigue, she appeared the most fragile creature in the world. While
I admired her understanding and fancy, I loved to tend on her, as I should
on a favourite animal; and I never saw so much grace both of person and
mind united to so little pretension.
Volume I 19
Every one adored Elizabeth. If the servants had any request to make,
it was always through her intercession. We were strangers to any species
of disunion and dispute; for although there was a great dissimilitude in
our characters, there was an harmony in that very dissimilitude. I was
more calm and philosophical than my companion; yet my temper was not
so yielding. My application was of longer endurance; but it was not so
severe whilst it endured. I delighted in investigating the facts relative to
the actual world; she busied herself in following the aërial creations of the
poets. The world was to me a secret, which I desired to discover; to her it
was a vacancy, which she sought to people with imaginations of her own.
My brothers were considerably younger than myself; but I had a friend
in one of my schoolfellows, who compensated for this deficiency. Henry
Clerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva, an intimate friend of my
father. He was a boy of singular talent and fancy. I remember, when he was
nine years old, he wrote a fairy tale, which was the delight and amazement
of all his companions. His favourite study consisted in books of chivalry
and romance; and when very young, I can remember, that we used to act
plays composed by him out of these favourite books, the principal characters of which were Orlando, Robin Hood, Amadis, and St. George.
No youth could have passed more happily than mine. My parents were
indulgent, and my companions amiable. Our studies were never forced;
and by some means we always had an end placed in view, which excited
us to ardour in the prosecution of them. It was by this method, and not by
emulation, that we were urged to application. Elizabeth was not incited
to apply herself to drawing, that her companions might not outstrip her;
but through the desire of pleasing her aunt, by the representation of some
favourite scene done by her own hand. We learned Latin and English, that
we might read the writings in those languages; and so far from study being
made odious to us through punishment, we loved application, and our
amusements would have been the labours of other children. Perhaps we
did not read so many books, or learn languages so quickly, as those who are
disciplined according to the ordinary methods; but what we learned was
impressed the more deeply on our memories.
In this description of our domestic circle I include Henry Clerval; for he
was constantly with us. He went to school with me, and generally passed
the afternoon at our house; for being an only child, and destitute of companions at home, his father was well pleased that he should find associates at
our house; and we were never completely happy when Clerval was absent.
I feel pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood, before misfortune had tainted my mind, and changed its bright visions of extensive 
20 FRANKENSTEIN
usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self. But, in drawing
the picture of my early days, I must not omit to record those events which
led, by insensible steps to my after tale of misery: for when I would account
to myself for the birth of that passion, which afterwards ruled my destiny,
I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost forgotten
sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent which, in its
course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.14
Natural philosophy15 is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire
therefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my predilection for that science. When I was thirteen years of age, we all went on a
party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon: the inclemency of the weather
obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In this house I chanced
to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa. I opened it with apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate, and the wonderful facts
which he relates, soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm. A new light
seemed to dawn upon my mind; and, bounding with joy, I communicated
my discovery to my father. I cannot help remarking here the many opportunities instructors possess of directing the attention of their pupils to useful
knowledge, which they utterly neglect. My father looked carelessly at the
14. This passage is about perceived momentum: the past reconstructed from the viewpoint of
the present always appears to have a structure, a momentum, and an obvious path. It is this
deep misconception in part that leads to optimism regarding the ability to predict the future and
to manipulate the present in such a way as to achieve desired future states. But the challenges
of technology and governance in an increasingly complex world mean that such optimism is both
hubristic and dysfunctional. It is hubristic because it dramatically overestimates the ability of
anyone, technologist or policy maker, to predict future paths of sociotechnological systems, and
it is dysfunctional because it leads to becoming lost in a haze of whimsical fantasy rather than
to putting effort into the difficult and constantly changing challenge of dealing ethically, responsibly,
and rationally with an ever-morphing, fundamentally unpredictable, real world. You can reach
back and claim there is a clear stream from your deep past to your present situation, but what
you are really doing is building an entirely normative reconstruction, an arbitrary and partial
one at best.

15. Natural philosophy and natural philosopher were broadly encompassing terms for the
theoretical and empirical inquiry into the natural world and those who conducted such inquiries.
The latter was used prior to the rise of the term scientist, which was not coined until 1834,
although Mary does use the word scientifical: “our family was not scientifical,” says Victor in
describing the Frankensteins (p. 22).
A biography of Humphry Davy (Golinksi 2016, 1) that focuses on how Davy, who was acquainted
with Mary’s father William Godwin and whose work was read by Mary, became “a scientist
before there was such a thing,” uses quotations from Mary’s novel as the epigraphs to each chapter,
as if to suggest that Davy’s difficulty in forging a scientific career is associated with and can be
communicated by Mary’s portrayal of Victor’s similar difficulties.

title-page of my book, and said, “Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! My dear Victor, do
not waste your time upon this; it is sad trash.”
If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me,
that the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded, and that a modern system of science had been introduced, which possessed much greater
powers than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical,
while those of the former were real and practical; under such circumstances,
I should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside, and, with my imagination
warmed as it was, should probably have applied myself to the more rational theory of chemistry 16 which has resulted from modern discoveries. It is
even possible, that the train of my ideas would never have received the fatal
impulse that led to my ruin. But the cursory glance my father had taken
of my volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with its
contents; and I continued to read with the greatest avidity.
When I returned home, my first care was to procure the whole works of
this author, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus.17 I read
and studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to
me treasures known to few beside myself; and although I often wished
to communicate these secret stores of knowledge to my father, yet his
16. Alchemy has roots in the ancient world, although the word itself comes from Arabic. It was
concerned primarily with the transformation of materials, notably the transmutation of base metals
such as lead and tin into gold and silver. Much historical alchemy can usefully be conceived as protochemistry and included such practices as metallurgy and the making of dyes and imitation gems.
Alchemy also had a strong connection with medicine, and for some in the Renaissance it came to
be associated with astrology, mysticism, and even magic. During the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries, alchemy was increasingly viewed as a pseudoscience and the domain of charlatans. Both
Victor’s father and Professor Krempe reflect this view and strongly distinguish between the
modern science of chemistry and irrational, premodern alchemy.
Joel A. Klein.
17. Many European alchemists in the Middle Ages and Renaissance believed that it was possible to
produce an “elixir” or medicine that could prolong life or even heal all diseases. Some, including
Cornelius Agrippa (Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim, 1486–1535), associated such elixirs
or medicines with the philosopher’s stone: a substance of alchemical legend that could turn metals
such as lead into gold. The medieval theologian Albertus Magnus (c. 1200–1280) did not officially
support such views, but a text called the Little Book on Alchemy that falsely purported—but was
widely believed—to be by Albertus did. The texts whose ideas on alchemy and life were most influential, however, were attributed to—although likely not penned by—the Renaissance physician
and iconoclast Paracelsus (1493–1541). In one of these, a work titled On the Nature of Things, the
author describes the artificial creation of a little human called a “homunculus” in a process vaguely
similar to Victor’s animation of “lifeless matter” (pp. 34, 37). Heating a sealed flask containing
putrefying semen would produce a human form after forty days, and the fully formed homunculus—which would have marvelous powers and knowledge—would be complete after forty weeks
of feeding with a preparation of human blood.

indefinite censure of my favourite Agrippa always withheld me. I disclosed
my discoveries to Elizabeth, therefore, under a promise of strict secrecy;
but she did not interest herself in the subject, and I was left by her to pursue my studies alone.
It may appear very strange, that a disciple of Albertus Magnus should
arise in the eighteenth century; but our family was not scientifical, and
I had not attended any of the lectures given at the schools of Geneva.18 My
dreams were therefore undisturbed by reality; and I entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the philosopher’s stone and the elixir of life.19
18. This passage implies that formal education is superior to being self-educated. Further, there
is a sentiment that formal schooling can ground someone in truth and that a person trying to
learn on his or her own may not be able to separate fiction from fact because he or she hasn’t been
taught what is right by someone else. This is a particularly interesting way to view schooling
because all schooling is biased in some way: by the curriculum developed, by the instructor’s views
on that curriculum, and even by what questions the instructor entertains in the classroom. There
is an assumed unbiased truth associated with formal schooling, but this assumption is flawed.
Sara Brownell.
19. Cornelius Agrippa remains among the most intellectually compelling magical theologians and
natural philosophers of his time. His magnum opus, De occulta philosophia libri tres (Three books
of occult philosophy), occupied the majority of his life, starting with a juvenile manuscript dedicated
to his teacher, Abbot Trithemius of Sponheim; it began to circulate in 1509–1510 and had a first
printed edition in 1531 and a final edited edition in 1533. The book attained wide print circulation,
appearing in German, Latin, and French editions before 1535 as well as in reprints and in English
throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Agrippa’s reputation as a dark magician
also grew, despite the lack of evidence to support it, and a fourth book spuriously attributed to him
was in fact a book of dark magic, appearing in English in the seventeenth century and outselling
the original work through the nineteenth century.
It is not clear whether Victor Frankenstein read De occulta philosophia, but his appreciation for
the “theory he [Agrippa] attempts to demonstrate” (p. 20) suggests he might have encountered the
magical cosmology it contained. Agrippa embeds magic in the Creation, contending that God placed
magic in the world as a system of connections, sympathies, and antipathies by which adepts could
transcend the natural sphere and influence the superior realms. Although De occulta philosophia
clearly engages with Neoplatonic philosophy and sees a clear path by which the study of God’s
work improves the adept, it is unique in that Agrippa also includes the possibility for the living adept
to transcend the natural sphere through magical work and to re-enter the godhead. Through the
spiritual improvement (requiring the adept to shed human desires and ambitions) required to attain
such magical skills, Agrippa believes the adept would use his magical skills to continue the world
order conceived by God—perhaps seeing the adept as an important source of defense in the case of
an apocalypse. It is not clear, however, what would happen if a disciplined but evil adept achieved
the godhead—perhaps he could derail the order of the world. At any rate, Victor’s sense that he can
equal God might have come from this text because he read it outside the context of Renaissance
theology and without understanding the tremendous discipline required of a magical adept. His
creature serves as an object lesson about the threats posed by undisciplined, ambition-fueled,
and ego-driven science. It does not operate as a corrective to the problems of Renaissance natural
philosophy solved by modern science but instead serves as evidence for the importance of the
increasingly common peer-reviewed and institutionally defined investigations that came to be
known as science in the early nineteenth century.

But the latter obtained my most undivided attention: wealth was an inferior object; but what glory would attend the discovery, if I could banish
disease from the human frame, and render man invulnerable to any but a
violent death!20
Nor were these my only visions. The raising of ghosts or devils was a
promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of which
I most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I
attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake, than to
a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors.21
The natural phænomena that take place every day before our eyes
did not escape my examinations. Distillation, and the wonderful effects
of steam, processes of which my favourite authors were utterly ignorant,
excited my astonishment; but my utmost wonder was engaged by some
experiments on an air-pump, which I saw employed by a gentleman whom
we were in the habit of visiting.
The ignorance of the early philosophers on these and several other
points served to decrease their credit with me: but I could not entirely throw
them aside, before some other system should occupy their place in my mind.
When I was about fifteen years old, we had retired to our house near
Belrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunder-storm. It
advanced from behind the mountains of Jura; and the thunder burst at once
with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. I remained,
while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight.
As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an
old and beautiful oak, which stood about twenty yards from our house; and
so soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing remained but a blasted stump. When we visited it the next morning,
20. The young, rebellious, intelligent, and ambitious Victor is motivated by the search for glory and
public renown. He wants to make a name for himself. He wants not just to be successful but to
be brilliantly, notoriously successful. And he seeks that glorious reputation through modern natural philosophy, what we now call experimental science, the “genius that … regulate[s his] fate”
(p. 20). Victor’s stated goal, to create a kind of immortality, is just the kind of thing that could bring
him the renown he desperately seeks.

21. Accepting the failure to learn as the student’s responsibility can be described as a studentdeficit model of instruction, where any gap in learning is the student’s fault and instructors are
presumed to be faultless in their teaching. This perspective also represents an instructor-centered
approach to teaching, where it is the student’s responsibility to listen to and learn from the
instructor. It stands in stark contrast to how many view education today as a constructivist activity
that should be student centered, where students are creating their own learning.

we found the tree shattered in a singular manner. It was not splintered by
the shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbands of wood. I never beheld
any thing so utterly destroyed.
The catastrophe of this tree excited my extreme astonishment; and I
eagerly inquired of my father the nature and origin of thunder and lightning. He replied, “Electricity”; describing at the same time the various
effects of that power. He constructed a small electrical machine, and exhibited a few experiments; he made also a kite, with a wire and string, which
drew down that fluid from the clouds.22
This last stroke completed the overthrow of Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus
Magnus, and Paracelsus, who had so long reigned the lords of my imagination. But by some fatality I did not feel inclined to commence the study of
any modern system; and this disinclination was influenced by the following circumstance.
My father expressed a wish that I should attend a course of lectures
upon natural philosophy, to which I cheerfully consented. Some accident
prevented my attending these lectures until the course was nearly finished.
The lecture, being therefore one of the last, was entirely incomprehensible
to me. The professor discoursed with the greatest fluency of potassium and
boron, of sulphates and oxyds, terms to which I could affix no idea; and I
became disgusted with the science of natural philosophy, although I still
read Pliny23 and Buffon24 with delight, authors, in my estimation, of nearly
equal interest and utility.
22. Dramatic encounters with natural phenomena are inspirations for scientific as well as literary
imagination. This passage reconstructs the way that the philosopher Francis Bacon (1561–1626)
thought that scientists come to understand natural phenomena and, in turn, use their understanding to construct technologies that make use of the same underlying processes. In describing
how Victor’s father translates the mechanisms of thunder and lightning into various technologies—
a small electrical machine (perhaps a galvanic pile and Leyden jar) and a kite that attracts
and conducts electricity (after Benjamin Franklin’s experiment), both of which were part of Percy
Shelley’s education—the passage foreshadows Victor’s eventual use of electricity to animate
the creature he creates. The sense of wonder the narrator describes at witnessing the storm
is important: delight, curiosity, awe, and other emotions motivate scientific inquiry by captivating
the imagination and emotions. Mary likely shared some of her protagonist’s emotions as she
endured the relentless rains and thunderstorms that plagued Geneva in the summer of 1816.

My occupations at this age were principally the mathematics, and
most of the branches of study appertaining to that science. I was busily
employed in learning languages; Latin was already familiar to me, and
I began to read some of the easiest Greek authors without the help of a
lexicon. I also perfectly understood English and German. This is the list of
my accomplishments at the age of seventeen; and you may conceive that
my hours were fully employed in acquiring and maintaining a knowledge
of this various literature.
Another task also devolved upon me, when I became the instructor of
my brothers. Ernest was six years younger than myself, and was my principal pupil. He had been afflicted with ill health from his infancy, through
which Elizabeth and I had been his constant nurses: his disposition was
gentle, but he was incapable of any severe application. William, the youngest of our family, was yet an infant, and the most beautiful little fellow in
the world; his lively blue eyes, dimpled cheeks, and endearing manners,
inspired the tenderest affection.
Such was our domestic circle, from which care and pain seemed for
ever banished. My father directed our studies, and my mother partook of
our enjoyments. Neither of us possessed the slightest pre-eminence over
the other; the voice of command was never heard amongst us; but mutual
affection engaged us all to comply with and obey the slightest desire of
each other.
CHAPTER II.
When I had attained the age of seventeen, my parents resolved that I
should become a student at the university of Ingolstadt. I had hitherto
attended the schools of Geneva; but my father thought it necessary, for the
completion of my education, that I should be made acquainted with other
customs than those of my native country. My departure was therefore fixed
at an early date; but, before the day resolved upon could arrive, the first
misfortune of my life occurred—an omen, as it were, of my future misery.
Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; but her illness was not severe,
and she quickly recovered. During her confinement, many arguments had
been urged to persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her.
Buffon proposed a theory that New World species, including humans, were degenerate compared
to Old World species. His theory led to a heated correspondence with Thomas Jefferson, who sent
samples of robust North American wildlife—including a stuffed moose—across the Atlantic to him.

She had, at first, yielded to our entreaties; but when she heard that her
favourite was recovering, she could no longer debar herself from her society,
and entered her chamber long before the danger of infection was past. The
consequences of this imprudence were fatal. On the third day my mother
sickened; her fever was very malignant, and the looks of her attendants
prognosticated the worst event. On her death-bed the fortitude and benignity of this admirable woman did not desert her. She joined the hands of
Elizabeth and myself: “My children,” she said, “my firmest hopes of future
happiness were placed on the prospect of your union. This expectation
will now be the consolation of your father. Elizabeth, my love, you must
supply my place to your younger cousins. Alas! I regret that I am taken
from you; and, happy and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you
all? But these are not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign
myself cheerfully to death, and will indulge a hope of meeting you in
another world.”
She died calmly; and her countenance expressed affection even in
death. I need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent
by that most irreparable evil,25 the void that presents itself to the soul, and
the despair that is exhibited on the countenance. It is so long before the
mind can persuade itself that she, whom we saw every day, and whose very
existence appeared a part of our own, can have departed for ever—that the
brightness of a beloved eye can have been extinguished, and the sound of a
voice so familiar, and dear to the ear, can be hushed, never more to be heard.
These are the reflections of the first days; but when the lapse of time proves
the reality of the evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences.26
Yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear connexion;
25. The death of the mother is seen as evil, indeed as an “irreparable evil.” As a child, Mary
would sit by her mother’s grave and read; this is a special form of grief that the created feel when
they lose those who created them. Much of Victor’s effort in making the creature is driven by
his thoughts about the evil of death, the finitude of human life. The passage here then goes on to
correlate the perception of an evil as evil with its emotional impact, in this case grief. Ironically,
when he succeeds in making the creature, he makes a motherless one.
Joel Gereboff.
26. When Victor describes his grief at the death of his mother, he focuses on its impact on him.
He grieves her absence rather than feeling sorrow for the pain she experienced in dying or for
the experiences of life she will now miss. Victor’s grief at his mother’s death plays a central role
in shaping his character going forward. It is the mirror of the creature’s experience in the novel.
Victor grieves the presence of an absence—that is, his mother. The creature grieves the presence
of an absence—that is, a friend, fellow, and mate. Given all that Victor knows of grief and loss,
we would expect him to be more sympathetic to the creature’s plight. He seems blind to the many
things he has in common with his creation. Perhaps he is willfully blind because he must continue
to dehumanize his creation in order to distance himself from it and from his responsibility for it. 
Volume I 27
and why should I describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel? The
time at length arrives, when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity;
and the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a sacrilege,
is not banished. My mother was dead, but we had still duties which we ought
to perform; we must continue our course with the rest, and learn to think
ourselves fortunate, whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized.
My journey to Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events, was
now again determined upon. I obtained from my father a respite of some
weeks. This period was spent sadly; my mother’s death, and my speedy
departure, depressed our spirits; but Elizabeth endeavoured to renew the
spirit of cheerfulness in our little society. Since the death of her aunt, her
mind had acquired new firmness and vigour. She determined to fulfil her
duties with the greatest exactness; and she felt that that most imperious
duty, of rendering her uncle and cousins happy, had devolved upon her. She
consoled me, amused her uncle, instructed my brothers; and I never beheld
her so enchanting as at this time, when she was continually endeavouring
to contribute to the happiness of others, entirely forgetful of herself.
The day of my departure at length arrived. I had taken leave of all my
friends, excepting Clerval, who spent the last evening with us. He bitterly
lamented that he was unable to accompany me: but his father could not
be persuaded to part with him, intending that he should become a partner with him in business, in compliance with his favourite theory, that
learning was superfluous in the commerce of ordinary life.27 Henry had a
refined mind; he had no desire to be idle, and was well pleased to become
his father’s partner, but he believed that a man might be a very good trader,
and yet possess a cultivated understanding.
We sat late, listening to his complaints, and making many little arrangements for the future. The next morning early I departed. Tears gushed
from the eyes of Elizabeth; they proceeded partly from sorrow at my departure, and partly because she reflected that the same journey was to have
taken place three months before, when a mother’s blessing would have
accompanied me.
It remains to be seen whether scientists and engineers, as creators, can afford to recognize themselves in their work or can afford not to.

27. Much of education now is focused on applied learning, in particular technical degrees, and
is intended to prepare a skilled workforce. This view was not the dominant one in Mary’s time,
when learning was thought to be for the privileged and not all that useful for everyday life.

28 FRANKENSTEIN
I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away, and indulged
in the most melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been surrounded by
amiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow
mutual pleasure, I was now alone. In the university, whither I was going, I
must form my own friends, and be my own protector. My life had hitherto
been remarkably secluded and domestic; and this had given me invincible
repugnance to new countenances. I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and Clerval; these were “old familiar faces”; but I believed myself totally unfitted
for the company of strangers. Such were my reflections as I commenced my
journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. I ardently desired
the acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at home, thought it hard
to remain during my youth cooped up in one place, and had longed to
enter the world, and take my station among other human beings. Now my
desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to repent.
I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my
journey to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing. At length the high
white steeple of the town met my eyes. I alighted, and was conducted to my
solitary apartment, to spend the evening as I pleased.
The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction, and paid a
visit to some of the principal professors, and among others to M. Krempe,
professor of natural philosophy. He received me with politeness, and asked
me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of
science appertaining to natural philosophy. I mentioned, it is true, with
fear and trembling, the only authors I had ever read upon those subjects.
The professor stared: “Have you,” he said, “really spent your time in studying such nonsense?”
I replied in the affirmative. “Every minute,” continued M. Krempe with
warmth, “every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and
entirely lost. You have burdened your memory with exploded systems, and
useless names. Good God! in what desert land have you lived, where no one
was kind enough to inform you that these fancies, which you have so greedily imbibed, are a thousand years old, and as musty as they are ancient?
I little expected in this enlightened and scientific age to find a disciple of
Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear Sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.”28
28. This passage is meant to illustrate a problem with self-learning: the autodidact (someone who
teaches himself or herself) may not know the appropriate texts to read or the appropriate way
to evaluate them. But the passage also raises the question of whether there is any benefit to be had
in reading about ways of thinking that are considered inaccurate in the current time. Are we so
certain in the dominant viewpoint of the time that previous ways of thinking do not hold any use?
Sara Brownell.
Volume I 29
So saying, he stept aside, and wrote down a list of several books treating of natural philosophy, which he desired me to procure, and dismissed
me, after mentioning that in the beginning of the following week he
intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural philosophy in its
general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow-professor, would lecture
upon chemistry the alternate days that he missed.
I returned home, not disappointed, for I had long considered those
authors useless whom the professor had so strongly reprobated; but I did
not feel much inclined to study the books which I procured at his recommendation. M. Krempe was a little squat man, with a gruff voice and repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in favour
of his doctrine. Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural
philosophy. It was very different, when the masters of the science sought
immortality and power;29 such views, although futile, were grand: but now
the scene was changed. The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit itself
to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in science was
chiefly founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.30
29. Many scholars argue that science and technology, especially as practiced in the West, have
always been about achieving “immortality and power” (see, e.g., The Religion of Technology [1997],
where David Noble notes that from the early Middle Ages “technology came to be identified more
closely with both lost perfection and the possibility of renewed perfection, and the advance of
the arts took on new significance, not only as evidence of grace, but as a means of preparation
for, and a sure sign of, imminent salvation” [12]). The Enlightenment in some ways was a profound
assertion of a humanistic perspective, and the end goals of that assertion, often not stated as
clearly as in this passage of the novel, have not changed that much. But before we challenge the
obvious hubris, it bears remembering that the opposite has also not changed: those who do
not seek immortality and power too often suffer, die young, and serve under another’s yoke.
Braden Allenby.
30. Victor suggests a change in the ways that natural philosophy is currently employed as compared to the past. The history he creates suggest that scientists of the past held higher aspirations
than his contemporaries, who, according to him, are interested in what science can show is not
possible rather than pressing the human imagination forward. Because this comparison was
made two centuries ago, it raises questions for modern readers about the common idea that the
sciences of the past had more scope for imagination (“boundless grandeur,” as Victor puts it)
than the sciences of today.
Despite his conviction about the impossibility of the quest of the masters of science for
“immortality and power,” Victor finds himself drawn to the “chimeras of boundless grandeur.”
The term chimera has two potential meanings captured here: the mythological Greek fire-breathing
monster with a lion’s head, a goat’s body, and a serpent’s tail or an illusory or impossible goal.
Mary’s careful word selection allows readers to see both definitions in her usage. The concept of
the chimera in modern biology (which of course would not have been known to Mary) is a single
organism composed of different zygotes, which is the merger of multiple fertilized eggs; this
multiple composition may happen through tissue transplant or mutation.
Hannah Rogers.
30 FRANKENSTEIN
Such were my reflections during the first two or three days spent
almost in solitude. But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the
information which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures. And
although I could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow
deliver sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M. Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.
Partly from curiosity, and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing
room, which M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very
unlike his colleague. He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an
aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few gray hairs covered his
temples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black. His person
was short, but remarkably erect; and his voice the sweetest I had ever
heard. He began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry
and the various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers. He
then took a cursory view of the present state of the science, and explained
many of its elementary terms. After having made a few preparatory experiments, he concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of
which I shall never forget:—
“The ancient teachers of this science,” said he, “promised impossibilities, and performed nothing. The modern masters promise very little; they
know that metals cannot be transmuted, and that the elixir of life is a
chimera. But these philosophers, whose hands seem only made to dabble
in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or crucible, have indeed
performed miracles. They penetrate into the recesses of nature, and shew
how she works in her hiding places. They ascend into the heavens; they
have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of the air we
breathe. They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can
command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock
the invisible world with its own shadows.”
I departed highly pleased with the professor and his lecture, and paid
him a visit the same evening. His manners in private were even more
mild and attractive than in public; for there was a certain dignity in his
mien during his lecture, which in his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness. He heard with attention my little narration
concerning my studies, and smiled at the names of Cornelius Agrippa,
and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had exhibited.
He said, that “these were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge.
They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names, and arrange in 
Volume I 31
connected classifications, the facts which they in a great degree had been
the instruments of bringing to light. The labours of men of genius, however
erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid
advantage of mankind.”31 I listened to his statement, which was delivered
without any presumption or affectation; and then added, that his lecture
had removed my prejudices against modern chemists; and I, at the same
time, requested his advice concerning the books I ought to procure.
“I am happy,” said M. Waldman, “to have gained a disciple; and if your
application equals your ability, I have no doubt of your success. Chemistry
is that branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements
have been and may be made; it is on that account that I have made it
my peculiar study; but at the same time I have not neglected the other
branches of science. A man would make but a very sorry chemist, if he
attended to that department of human knowledge alone. If your wish is to
become really a man of science, and not merely a petty experimentalist, I
should advise you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy, including
mathematics.”
He then took me into his laboratory, and explained to me the uses of
his various machines; instructing me as to what I ought to procure, and
promising me the use of his own, when I should have advanced far enough
in the science not to derange their mechanism. He also gave me the list of
books which I had requested; and I took my leave.
Thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.
CHAPTER III.
From this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the most
comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation. I read
with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination, which modern inquirers have written on these subjects. I attended the lectures, and
cultivated the acquaintance, of the men of science of the university; and I
found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense and real information,
combined, it is true, with a repulsive physiognomy and manners, but not
on that account the less valuable. In M. Waldman I found a true friend.
31. A major rationale for the autonomy of science and scientists—that is, their ability to make
their own choices free from interference by governments or lay people—in their pursuit of
knowledge is the presumed certainty of the superior instrumental outcome of that pursuit, regardless of the potential presence of error or bias. According to chemist and philosopher of science
Michael Polanyi, the ideal organization is “scientists, freely making their own choice of problems
and pursuing them in the light of their own personal judgment” (1962, 54).
David H. Guston.
32 FRANKENSTEIN
His gentleness was never tinged by dogmatism; and his instructions were
given with an air of frankness and good nature, that banished every idea of
pedantry. It was, perhaps, the amiable character of this man that inclined
me more to that branch of natural philosophy which he professed, than an
intrinsic love for the science itself. But this state of mind had place only
in the first steps towards knowledge: the more fully I entered into the science, the more exclusively I pursued it for its own sake.32 That application,
which at first had been a matter of duty and resolution, now became so
ardent and eager, that the stars often disappeared in the light of morning
whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.
As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that I improved rapidly.
My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students; and my proficiency,
that of the masters. Professor Krempe often asked me, with a sly smile,
how Cornelius Agrippa went on? whilst M. Waldman expressed the most
heartfelt exultation in my progress. Two years passed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was engaged, heart and soul, in the
pursuit of some discoveries, which I hoped to make. None but those who
have experienced them can conceive of the enticements of science. In other
studies you go as far as others have gone before you, and there is nothing
more to know; but in a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery
and wonder. A mind of moderate capacity, which closely pursues one study,
32. The idea of a having a single scientific mentor is not ideal, and Victor knows this well. He is
mentored by two complementary, imperfect, and valuable individuals—namely, M. Krempe
and M. Waldman. We see that scientific mentoring does not take place in a vacuum. Developmental
psychologist Jean Piaget described the process of intellectual development with the words
“intelligence organizes the world by organizing itself” (quoted in Chess and Hassibi 1978, 63). One
reading of Piaget suggests that he models learning as a complex adaptive system, and so as
the human body experiences stimuli, it begins to organize and anticipate stimuli, creating complex
systems of mental actions and anticipated results in an effort to predict and control stimuli to
generate more favorable results. As a result, collaborative interactions among individuals with
different perspectives and experiences (mentor and mentee) provide conversational stimuli for
developing new understandings. L. S. Vygotsky, citing Piaget, describes a similar process: “Such
observations [of child argumentation] prompted Piaget to conclude that communication produces
the need for checking and confirming thoughts, a process that is characteristic of adult thought”
(1978, 90). Mentor–mentee dynamics create the stimuli that drive Victor’s curiosity, creativity, and
learning. M. Waldman, who loves chemistry, notes that “I have not neglected the other branches
of science” (p. 31), impressing the importance of interdisciplinary learning on Victor. As this
passage shows, passion for learning is also the outcome of dual mentorship: “natural philosophy,
and particularly chemistry, in the most comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole
occupation.” Finally, the search for knowledge, regardless of direction, drives Victor’s research.
Discipline, passion, focus, and effective diverse mentorship philosophies characterize Victor’s
status at this time.

must infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit, and was solely wrapt
up in this, improved so rapidly, that, at the end of two years, I made some
discoveries in the improvement of some chemical instruments, which
procured me great esteem and admiration at the university. When I had
arrived at this point, and had become as well acquainted with the theory
and practice of natural philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of the
professors at Ingolstadt, my residence there being no longer conducive
to my improvements, I thought of returning to my friends and my native
town, when an incident happened that protracted my stay.
One of the phænomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention
was the structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued
with life. Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed? It
was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a mystery;
yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted,
if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our inquiries. I revolved these
circumstances in my mind, and determined thenceforth to apply myself
more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy which relate to
physiology. Unless I had been animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this study would have been irksome, and almost
intolerable. To examine the causes of life, we must first have recourse to
death. I became acquainted with the science of anatomy: but this was not
sufficient; I must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the
human body. In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions
that my mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not
ever remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition, or to have feared
the apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon my fancy; and a
church-yard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life,
which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become food for the
worm. Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay, and
forced to spend days and nights in vaults and charnel houses. My attention
was fixed upon every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the
human feelings. I saw how the fine form of man was degraded and wasted;
I beheld the corruption of death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I
saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the eye and brain. I paused,
examining and analysing all the minutiæ of causation, as exemplified in
the change from life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this
darkness a sudden light broke in upon me—a light so brilliant and wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity of the
prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so many men of 
34 FRANKENSTEIN
genius, who had directed their inquiries towards the same science, that I
alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a secret.33
Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun does not
more certainly shine in the heavens, than that which I now affirm is true.
Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the discovery were
distinct and probable. After days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue,
I succeeded in discovering the cause of generation and life; nay, more, I
became myself capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter.34
The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery
soon gave place to delight and rapture. After so much time spent in painful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires, was the most
gratifying consummation of my toils. But this discovery was so great and
overwhelming, that all the steps by which I had been progressively led
to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result. What had been the
study and desire of the wisest men since the creation of the world, was
now within my grasp. Not that, like a magic scene, it all opened upon me
at once: the information I had obtained was of a nature rather to direct my
endeavours so soon as I should point them towards the object of my search,
than to exhibit that object already accomplished. I was like the Arabian
who had been buried with the dead, and found a passage to life aided only
by one glimmering, and seemingly ineffectual, light.
I see by your eagerness, and the wonder and hope which your eyes
express, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with which
I am acquainted; that cannot be: listen patiently until the end of my story,
33. Biologists can seem godlike in their laboratory research, making decisions pertaining to animal
and human life while having little immediate need to answer to anyone save their conscience.
What kind of ethics does practicing applied biological science require? A personal ethics of individual
morality pertaining to, for example, dishonesty and irresponsibility in observing humane practice?
A research ethics pertaining to, for example, what specific “raw” material is used, what the source
of the “raw” material is, and what the individual researcher or group of researchers is doing with
the “raw” material? Or a social ethics pertaining to the positive and negative social impacts the biological research might have at present and in the future? Because the gradations between personal
research and social ethics are rarely so distinct, how should biologists relate to them? How does
Victor relate to his raw “materials” (p. 36)?
Miguel Astor-Aguilera.
34. Victor here claims to have invented a way to instill life. The narrative does not delve into
questions of ownership or patenting, but future narratives building on Frankenstein do, in novels
(e.g., Next by Michael Crichton [2006]), film (Blade Runner [Ridley Scott, 1986]), and television
(Orphan Black [BBC, 2013–]). Patenting adds the motivation of financial reward to scientific fame
and glory, and it can provide motivations for both holding something secret, until rights are
secured, and publicizing it after rights are granted.

and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that subject. I will
not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was, to your destruction
and infallible misery. Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my
example, how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge, and how much
happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world, than he
who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow.
When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands,35 I hesitated a long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it.
Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to prepare
a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of fibres, muscles,
and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable difficulty and labour.36
35. Victor engages materiality in a much different manner than his not-so-distant pre-Enlightenment European brethren. He equates “life” with animate human bodies; however, animated life
is found throughout Earth in a variety of organic forms. Do not simple cells move and have life?
Plants also move, though most of them quite slowly, and have frames composed of “fibres,
muscles, and veins” conceptually analogous to those of animals. What of plants’ visible animation,
seeming to indicate volition: vines creeping along the sides of buildings toward where there is
more light, sunflowers’ “faces” following the path of the sun, predatory Venus flytraps moving quite
quickly to ensnare their victims, and the Mimosa pudica, the “sleepy plant” in Mesoamerica (also
found in Melanesia and Africa), shying away when touched and then recomposing itself after
apparent danger has subsided? When do we, if we do, grant plants, nonhuman animals, and human
animals volition and at what stage of life? Do only human animals have emotions and volition?
Do simple cells shy away if they are nudged or pricked and move away if they bump into another
mobile simple cell?
Miguel Astor-Aguilera.
36. Victor finds himself chasing a “frame” of flesh and its union with life. His ambition reflects several forms of mechanistic thought current at the time Mary wrote Frankenstein: an understanding
of biological systems as physical machines controlled solely by physical laws. Nineteenth-century
biology and physiology embraced and developed mechanistic perspectives while at the same
time discarding earlier kindred understandings of the body. In the seventeenth century, the conceptualization of the human body by René Descartes (1596–1650) was similarly mechanistic, but he
explained the transition from physical machine to a living, thinking entity as an act of God. The deity
endowed otherwise idle material with consciousness. By Mary’s time, the latter part of Decartes’s
argument had lost favor, but mechanistic ideas had gained scientific prominence.
Victor’s “frame” is a product of part-by-part fabrication and lacks “animation”—then a term
for the state of being alive. His power makes the idle machine something living. In a sense,
the story presents a separation between body and consciousness similar to the one championed
by Descartes. And yet no deity is at work. Victor installs life into his constructed “frame” using
only his scientific prowess.
Mechanistic thought remains an important part of the life sciences, and the ambition to build
frames for life is found in twenty-first-century efforts to produce so-called protocells or, in the
language of some synthetic biologists, the “chassis.” The structures, built with basic chemicals
“from the ground up,” are envelopes for biological phenomena. Although present-day research is
unlikely to deliver anything like Mary’s creature, it holds to a similar concept of life as machine.
Descartes long ago lost his place in the natural sciences, and Victor’s power has yet to be realized,
but mechanistic thinking persists.

I doubted at first whether I should attempt the creation of a being like
myself or one of simpler organization; but my imagination was too much
exalted by my first success to permit me to doubt of my ability to give life
to an animal as complex and wonderful as man.37 The materials at present
within my command hardly appeared adequate to so arduous an undertaking; but I doubted not that I should ultimately succeed. I prepared myself
for a multitude of reverses; my operations might be incessantly baffled,
and at last my work be imperfect: yet, when I considered the improvement
which every day takes place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to
hope my present attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success. Nor could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any
argument of its impracticability. It was with these feelings that I began the
creation of a human being.38 As the minuteness of the parts formed a great
37. Although Victor begins this passage hesitant of his ability to create a creature like himself,
he says that his imagination overtakes his questions. He pictures his imagination as an element of
his personality motivated by its own success. The idea of imagination as internal to the self might
remind the modern reader of the concept of the ego as developed by psychologist Sigmund Freud
more than one hundred years after Mary wrote Frankenstein (The Ego and the Id [(1923) 1960]).
Freud’s ego is that part of the human psyche modified by external forces. The success of his initial
work leaves Victor unable to doubt this ability to create a human life. In a cyclical fashion, detached
from material realities, this type of imagination is empowered by its own interplay internally.
The ability to act based on imagination and the changing of the imagination itself in relation to
those actions are fundamental to Victor’s understanding of the concept.
Hannah Rogers.
38. With “creation,” Mary draws on some of the widest possible literary themes, and the
biblical resonances are emphasized by the creature himself. But creativity and the labor of one’s
hands had multiple significances within wider nineteenth-century society, as they do today.
It is not often recognized, for instance, that creativity and labor play a crucial role in legitimizing
the idea of “property.” How do we justify establishing ownership over something? One important
argument, most directly associated with the political philosophy of John Locke (1632–1704),
stated that applying one’s labor to nature through writing, crafting, and so on made that
creation one’s property (see Locke 1821). For example, earthen clay, once owned by everyone,
through a transformative act of labor and creativity (so the argument goes) becomes a single
person’s property.
Through Frankenstein, we can therefore question scientific work and its ownership. Although
we might arbitrarily decide that humans are exempt from being classed as property—a decision
not yet achieved in Mary’s time—what of the creature? Is it right to think of the term creation
as implying ownership? Or what of the ownership of children created by parents? Or what of the
ownership of any nonhuman organism for that matter? Should it be the case that merely the
act of laboring on something makes it property? The existence of Victor’s potential proprietary
rights in his work and his (irresponsible?) refusal to acknowledge those rights allow us to
generalize the significance of his creative act. Perhaps it is not in the creation of a human that
he errs but in the conceptualization of his labors.

hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first intention, to make
the being of a gigantic stature; that is to say, about eight feet in height,
and proportionably large. After having formed this determination, and
having spent some months in successfully collecting and arranging my
materials, I began.
No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like
a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. Life and death appeared to
me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and pour a torrent of
light into our dark world. A new species would bless me as its creator and
source;39 many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me.40
No father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should
deserve their’s. Pursuing these reflections, I thought, that if I could bestow
animation upon lifeless matter, I might in process of time (although I now
39. The religious language of this passage connects Victor’s ambitions to a long tradition of
humans playing god. In Jewish folklore, for instance, several great rabbis are said to have made
clay animate, much as Adam was formed from clay according to biblical legend. These animated
clay creatures are known as golems, and they resemble men except for the fact that they are
mindlessly obedient. Following orders literally, they inevitably become destructive, revealing their
creators’ arrogance by showing those creators’ limited foresight and the perils of hubris. Similar
patterns play out in many cautionary tales about technology, such as R.U.R. by Karel Čapek and
Josef Čapek (1920), a play in which robots confound the expectations of their builders by becoming
violently rebellious. And yet although we are philosophically attuned to our arrogance, and although
hubris is a persistent theme in mythology and literature (including Frankenstein), the temptation
to play god seems only to increase with the increasing power of science and technology. This
phenomenon is especially evident in two fields of active research: synthetic biology and artificial
intelligence (AI). Central to the agenda of synthetic biology is a literal desire to create new species:
for example, bespoke organisms such as Mycoplasma mycoides JCVI-syn1.0, which the J. Craig
Venter Institute made in 2010 by inserting a lab-assembled genome into a bacterium. The promise
of synthetic biology is total genetic control of organisms that can bless us with new foods, drugs,
and fuels. The peril is that the future behavior of such bespoke organisms, like that of the Čapeks’
robots, cannot be completely predicted. AI is arguably even more hubristic—and perilous—
because of the potential for machine intelligence to exceed—or be incomprehensible by—human
intelligence. From a superhuman AI’s perspective, arrogant Homo sapiens might be deemed as
dangerously irrational as Victor’s creature or golems.
Jonathon Keats.
40. There is a notion that scientists become so engrossed in their own pursuits that they forget
that they are “standing on the shoulders of giants,” as Sir Isaac Newton (1642–1726) put it,
and instead feel overweening pride of ownership in the science they are studying and in the results
of their research. Such an attitude, occurring time and again in the history of science, impedes
scientific progress. In science, knowledge cannot be owned by anyone. Knowledge must be shared,
must be questioned, must be built upon. Here Victor gets lost in his own ability as a scientist.
He forgets that although he may create something new (be it knowledge or life), he is not truly
the owner of those creations.

found it impossible) renew life41 where death had apparently devoted the
body to corruption.42
These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking
with unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with study, and my
person had become emaciated with confinement. Sometimes, on the very
brink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the next day
or the next hour might realize. One secret which I alone possessed was the
hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon gazed on my midnight
labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness, I pursued nature
to her hiding places.43 Who shall conceive the horrors of my secret toil,
41. Victor here implies flesh-and-blood immortality because the universe inherently and automatically renews life from death. All life on Earth depends on things cyclically dying as other things,
including humans, procreate, live, flourish, and eventually die as the cycle continues. Victor, due to
the very emotional personal experience of having a person he loves pass unto death, desires
that humans need not have to die and hence is driven to seek the “secret” to life regeneration. Life
renewing from death is present in biblical scripture (Genesis 3:19, 18:27; Job 30:19; Ecclesiastes
3:20) as well as in the Anglican Christian Book of Common Prayer (Burial Rite 1:485, 2:501) and
is a topic highly present, though different ontologically from Judeo-Christian-Muslim views, in
indigenous cosmologies (Astor-Aguilera 2010). Some of the world’s societies have been known to
practice infanticide or care for their elderly only up until they become too much of a burden on
the younger population, which needs a certain amount of resources to survive. How old is old
enough for a human to live and at what cost to Earth’s resources? Should humans not die at
all and be perpetually regenerated through scientific breakthroughs?
Miguel Astor-Aguilera.
42. Victor articulates a set of hypothesized or imagined consequences for his research should it
succeed, including the conquering of death and the creation of a race of beings who would worship
him. These “imaginaries” are fictions that follow, reasonably but not necessarily, from success in
his research. Perhaps at this point, Victor might have explored what fictions might reasonably but
not necessarily follow from failure or from a different or incomplete kind of success.
David H. Guston.
43. Victor chooses to conduct his experiments with life in secret; he isolates himself from friends,
family, and colleagues at his university. The isolation is both geographical and social. During the
period of feverish research and creation, he doesn’t exchange correspondence or share his ideas
with anyone.
Isolation makes it possible for Victor to undertake his grisly and socially unacceptable project.
Certainly, his colleagues and family would have intervened to stop him. But Victor’s self-imposed
isolation also makes it impossible for the creature to gain access to the social resources he needs
to construct a livable life (J. Butler 2010). He is cut off from the possibility of family, friends, and
membership in society. He removes himself from the structured and institutionalized relationships
that we depend on for sustenance, fellowship, and relief, such as education, health care, and a
humane justice system.
An individual depends in countless ways on being recognized as a social being—as a person
with feelings and rights, enjoying fellowship in social groups, relying on institutions to provide
support, to safeguard our rights, and to care for us when we are in need. Victor’s decision to
conduct his work in isolation and his abandonment of the creature at birth makes it impossible
for the creature ever to achieve this social legibility and to participate functionally in society.

as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave, or tortured the
living animal to animate the lifeless clay? 44 My limbs now tremble, and my
eyes swim with the remembrance; but then a resistless, and almost frantic
impulse, urged me forward; I seemed to have lost all soul or sensation but
for this one pursuit. It was indeed but a passing trance, that only made me
feel with renewed acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing
to operate, I had returned to my old habits. I collected bones from charnel
houses; and disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the
human frame. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house,
and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase, I
kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from their
sockets in attending to the details of my employment. The dissecting room
and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials; and often did my
human nature turn with loathing from my occupation, whilst, still urged
on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I brought my work near
to a conclusion.45
As a result, we see the creature as a vagrant, an outlaw, and a vigilante throughout the novel.
All of these identities are built on a foundation of social exclusion. Victor’s isolation means that
the creature has little choice but to become a monster. He is left with no pathways into a peaceful
life inside of human society.
Joey Eschrich.
44. Victor’s grave robbing and torture of animals raise the following questions: Do the ends ever
justify the means in research or in other areas? If useful data can be gathered through unethical
means, should they be? And if such data are so gathered, ought they to form part of the evidence
base of science? Analysis of the history of human experimentation in the twentieth century
comes solidly down on the negative answer, based on experiences like those of concentration
camp inmates experimented on by Nazi doctors during World War II and of African Americans and
Guatemalans experimented on by US Public Health Service researchers in the decades following
the war. The principles of bioethics hold that human beings may never be used solely as experimental means to a scientific end, but human autonomy can also create an affirmative role for
self-sacrifice, allowing people ethically to volunteer for dangerous experiments. Some bioethicists
also argue that if a practice is physically or viscerally repugnant—“the horrors of my secret toil,”
in Victor’s words (p. 38)—then the practice is at least suspect of being morally repugnant. For a
time, the ethical debate about human embryonic stem cell research focused on whether medical
science should be permitted to progress based on research that was putatively unethical in its
destruction of human embryos to derive human pluripotent stem cells. Is such research always
spoiled as the fruit of evil exploits?
David H. Guston and Jason Scott Robert.
45. Victor here expresses pangs of conscience as he reflects on his singular goal of animating life.
To what extent he sees his conscience as a reliable guide is not clear, for in the end he continues
his activities despite these reservations. A sharp emotional reaction of loathing cannot overcome
his intense drive, his eagerness, to complete his task of animating life. Here the novel gives expression to the tension between emotional, morally significant reactions and human desire and drive.

The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul,
in one pursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields bestow
a more plentiful harvest, or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage: but
my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature. And the same feelings
which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also to forget
those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had not seen for
so long a time. I knew my silence disquieted them; and I well remembered
the words of my father: “I know that while you are pleased with yourself,
you will think of us with affection, and we shall hear regularly from you.
You must pardon me, if I regard any interruption in your correspondence
as a proof that your other duties are equally neglected.”
I knew well therefore what would be my father’s feelings; but I could
not tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which
had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination.46 I wished, as it were, to
procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection until the great
object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature, should be completed.
I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect
to vice, or faultiness on my part; but I am now convinced that he was justified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from blame. A human
being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind,
and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity.
I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule.
If the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your
affections, and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which
no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly unlawful, that is to
say, not befitting the human mind. If this rule were always observed; if no
man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of
his domestic affections, Greece had not been enslaved; Cæsar would have
spared his country; America would have been discovered more gradually;
and the empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.
But I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my
tale; and your looks remind me to proceed.
My father made no reproach in his letters; and only took notice of my
silence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before.
46. Victor’s unease at dealing with body parts from the dead is overpowered by the force of his
imagination propelling him to complete his work. The relationship between imagination, creativity,
and conventional views expressed in this case as strongly negative emotions recurs throughout
the novel. And in sticking with his project, Victor overcomes his own feelings and dismisses his
father’s. At hand is the question of to what extent feelings express with accuracy what ought to
be done morally.

Winter, spring, and summer, passed away during my labours; but I did not
watch the blossom or the expanding leaves—sights which before always
yielded me supreme delight, so deeply was I engrossed in my occupation.
The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near to a close;
and now every day shewed me more plainly how well I had succeeded. But
my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared rather like one
doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other unwholesome trade, than
an artist occupied by his favourite employment. Every night I was oppressed
by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most painful degree; a disease
that I regretted the more because I had hitherto enjoyed most excellent
health, and had always boasted of the firmness of my nerves. But I believed
that exercise and amusement would soon drive away such symptoms; and I
promised myself both of these, when my creation should be complete.
CHAPTER IV.
It was on a dreary night of November, that I beheld the accomplishment of
my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected the
instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the
lifeless thing 47 that lay at my feet. It was already one in the morning; the
rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt
out, when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull
yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion
agitated its limbs.
How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the
wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form?48
47. Mary refers to a “spark” that animates Victor’s creature and brings him to life. This reference
alludes to the use of electricity to reanimate a body, a relatively new idea at the time of this
novel’s publication. Toward the end of the eighteenth century, Luigi Galvani (1737–1798) had
demonstrated the use of electrical current to activate muscle, a discovery he made on dissected
frog legs. Mary was well aware of these experiments, and Galvani’s work was one of her main
influences in generating the idea for her novel. Furthermore, these principles have endured in
medicine. Today, electric stimulation is used to aid millions of human bodies with everything
from defibrillators and pacemakers to partial treatments for paralysis and systems that link
prosthetic limbs and cameras to the brain.
Stephanie Naufel.
48. Emotions again serve to express assessments. On the surface, they are assumed to be correct
moral judgments, though in the end their accuracy is questioned implicitly when Victor’s rejection
and horror drive the creature away and lead over time to the creature’s loneliness. The experience of
isolation and deprivation of basic social relations turn the creature from a natural disposition toward
goodness to a disposition toward evil that impels him to engage in horrific and destructive acts.

His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful.
Beautiful!—Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his
teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour
as the dun white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion,
and straight black lips.49
The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings
of human nature. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole
purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body.50 For this I had deprived
myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded
moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished,
and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart. Unable to endure the
aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of the room, and continued a
long time traversing my bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep.
At length lassitude succeeded to the tumult I had before endured; and I
threw myself on the bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments
of forgetfulness. But it was in vain: I slept indeed, but I was disturbed
49. Victor characterizes the moment he succeeds in bringing his creation to life—when the
creation opens his eyes and gazes back—as a “catastrophe.” Contrast this scene with the same
moment of creation of intelligence noted in Genesis 1:32: “God saw all that he had made, and it
was very good.” An enduring conversation in the philosophy of beauty asks whether beauty is more
an innate property of the “thing” being considered or resides instead in the eye of the beholder.
Conflations of beauty and goodness are also quite common in both popular culture and philosophical
inquiry. In many ways, this entire novel explores the relationship between beauty, goodness, and
perceptions. In the end, Victor’s characterization of his creature depends more on Victor himself
than on the creature’s identity. Outward perceptions of beauty or the lack thereof influence how
others understand the creature and whether they perceive his actions as “good” or “evil.” Imagine
how the story would unfold if Victor were instead to have looked upon his creature at this very
moment and felt that it “was good.” In the scene as given in the novel, Victor looks for himself in
the creature’s eyes and finds someone else.
Stephani Etheridge Woodson.
50. Victor constantly equates “life” with animation. Does animacy provide life, or is that function
served by the metaphysical soul purportedly found within active human bodies? Within JudeoChristian-Muslim religions, it is the sacred soul placed within the human body during fetal
development by a divine God that makes life different in humans from other animals. Nonhuman
animals are treated differently from humans in Western society, whereas many non-Western
societies do not make a striking difference from human to animal to plant (Astor-Aguilera 2010).
For Western humans, the divine soul is what makes life sacrosanct, but nonhuman animal life
is typically not as important. Is Victor playing God in his laboratory research, trying to infuse life or
the spark of a soul within a human body composed of inactive tissue? When is the “soul” present
in humans, if at all? Is soul matter inherent to human tissue at conception and therefore present in
stem cells?

by the wildest dreams. I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health,
walking in the streets of Ingolstadt. Delighted and surprised, I embraced
her; but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became lurid with the
hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I held
the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her form,
and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel. I started
from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and yellow light
of the moon, as it forced its way through the window-shutters, I beheld
the wretch—the miserable monster whom I had created. He held up the
curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they may be called, were fixed on
me. His jaws opened, and he muttered some inarticulate sounds, while a
grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have spoken, but I did not hear; one
hand was stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but I escaped, and rushed
down stairs. I took refuge in the court-yard belonging to the house which I
inhabited; where I remained during the rest of the night, walking up and
down in the greatest agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing
each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse
to which I had so miserably given life.
Oh! no mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummy
again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch.51
I had gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then; but when those
muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing such
as even Dante could not have conceived.
51. Egyptian mummies were present in the British Museum since the mid-1750s, donated by
private antiquity collectors. British attention to ancient Egypt broadened during Napoleon’s campaign of 1798–1801; his inclusion of scholars with his army was mocked in England as wartime
propaganda, but the French documented and exported antiquities that were later transferred to
London after their defeat. Probably more important than these events to the interpretation of
Mary’s text, however, is the use of the purported curative powder “mummia” or “mummy,” which
had been available throughout Europe since the twelfth century. Referred to as both medicine
and pigment by early English writers including Edmund Spenser, William Shakespeare, and John
Donne, mummia was either the bituminous substance used in mummification to dry out body
cavities after the removal of organs or the ground-up body parts of mummies themselves when
this bituminous substance was in short supply. Mary’s reference to mummies here and later in
Walton’s characterization of the texture and color of the creature’s hand (p. 183) may serve several
purposes: (1) Ancient mummification enabled the preserved body to be available for use by the
spirit in the afterlife—another kind of reanimation of a dead body. (2) The creature’s mummylike
hand would have exhibited the characteristic darkened skin produced by the drying material,
whereas the creature’s facial skin is elsewhere described as yellow, further highlighting his
patchwork nature. (3) In light of the mutilation of mummified bodies for questionable medicinal
treatments, is it possible that Mary used the term mummy to enhance her ethical critique?

44 FRANKENSTEIN
I passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and
hardly, that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly sank
to the ground through languor and extreme weakness. Mingled with this
horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment: dreams that had been my
food and pleasant rest for so long a space, were now become a hell to me;
and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!
Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned, and discovered to my
sleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple and
clock, which indicated the sixth hour. The porter opened the gates of the
court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into the streets,
pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the wretch whom I
feared every turning of the street would present to my view.52 I did not dare
return to the apartment which I inhabited, but felt impelled to hurry on,
although wetted by the rain, which poured from a black and comfortless sky.
I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring, by
bodily exercise, to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I traversed
the streets, without any clear conception of where I was, or what I was
doing. My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear; and I hurried on with
irregular steps, not daring to look about me:
Like one who, on a lonely road,
Doth walk in fear and dread,
And, having once turn’d round, walks on,
And turns no more his head;
Because he knows a frightful fiend
Doth close behind him tread.53
Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the
various diligences and carriages usually stopped. Here I paused, I knew
not why; but I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that
was coming towards me from the other end of the street. As it drew nearer,
I observed that it was the Swiss diligence: it stopped just where I was
standing; and, on the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who,
on seeing me, instantly sprung out. “My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed he,
52. It is understandable that Victor would experience feelings of fear and awe after realizing he
successfully created life, especially given the strength and power of his creation. However,
abandoning and then “avoid[ing] the wretch” because of this fear means he also avoids taking
responsibility for his creature’s life and suffering. Victor’s avoidance does not lead to the protection
of himself and his loved ones, and it intensifies the creature’s anguish and destructive behavior.

Volume I 45
“how glad I am to see you! how fortunate that you should be here at the very
moment of my alighting!”
Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought
back to my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so
dear to my recollection. I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my
horror and misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many
months, calm and serene joy. I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most
cordial manner, and we walked towards my college. Clerval continued
talking for some time about our mutual friends, and his own good fortune
in being permitted to come to Ingolstadt. “You may easily believe,” said he,
“how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that it was not absolutely necessary for a merchant not to understand any thing except bookkeeping; and, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his
constant answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the
Dutch school-master in the Vicar of Wakefield: ‘I have ten thousand florins
a year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.’ But his affection for
me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he has permitted me to
undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of knowledge.”
“It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left my
father, brothers, and Elizabeth.”
“Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from you
so seldom. By the bye, I mean to lecture you a little upon their account
myself.—But, my dear Frankenstein,” continued he, stopping short, and
gazing full in my face, “I did not before remark how very ill you appear;
so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for several nights.”
“You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one
occupation, that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see: but I
hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an end, and
that I am at length free.”
I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to
allude to the occurrences of the preceding night. I walked with a quick pace,
and we soon arrived at my college. I then reflected, and the thought made
me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my apartment might still
be there, alive, and walking about. I dreaded to behold this monster; but I
feared still more that Henry should see him. Entreating him therefore to
remain a few minutes at the bottom of the stairs, I darted up towards my
own room. My hand was already on the lock of the door before I recollected
myself. I then paused; and a cold shivering came over me. I threw the door
forcibly open, as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre
to stand in waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared. I 
46 FRANKENSTEIN
stepped fearfully in: the apartment was empty; and my bed-room was also
freed from its hideous guest. I could hardly believe that so great a goodfortune could have befallen me; but when I became assured that my enemy
had indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy, and ran down to Clerval.
We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast; but I was unable to contain myself. It was not joy only that possessed
me; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse beat
rapidly. I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same place; I
jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud. Clerval
at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival; but when he
observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes for which he
could not account; and my loud, unrestrained, heartless laughter, frightened and astonished him.
“My dear Victor,” cried he, “what, for God’s sake, is the matter? Do not
laugh in that manner. How ill you are! What is the cause of all this?”
“Do not ask me,” cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I thought
I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; “he can tell.—Oh, save me!
save me!” I imagined that the monster seized me; I struggled furiously, and
fell down in a fit.
Poor Clerval! what must have been his feelings? A meeting, which he
anticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness. But I was not
the witness of his grief; for I was lifeless, and did not recover my senses for
a long, long time.
This was the commencement of a nervous fever, which confined me for
several months. During all that time Henry was my only nurse. I afterwards
learned that, knowing my father’s advanced age, and unfitness for so long
a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make Elizabeth, he spared
them this grief by concealing the extent of my disorder. He knew that I
could not have a more kind and attentive nurse than himself; and, firm
in the hope he felt of my recovery, he did not doubt that, instead of doing
harm, he performed the kindest action that he could towards them.
But I was in reality very ill; and surely nothing but the unbounded and
unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life. The
form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever before
my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him. Doubtless my words surprised Henry: he at first believed them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagination; but the pertinacity with which I continually recurred
to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed its origin
to some uncommon and terrible event.
Volume I 47
By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses, that alarmed and
grieved my friend, I recovered. I remember the first time I became capable
of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I perceived that
the fallen leaves had disappeared, and that the young buds were shooting
forth from the trees that shaded my window. It was a divine spring; and the
season contributed greatly to my convalescence. I felt also sentiments of joy
and affection revive in my bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time
I became as cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion.
“Dearest Clerval,” exclaimed I, “how kind, how very good you are to
me. This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you promised
yourself, has been consumed in my sick room. How shall I ever repay you?
I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which I have been the
occasion; but you will forgive me.”
“You will repay me entirely, if you do not discompose yourself, but get
well as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, I may
speak to you on one subject, may I not?”
I trembled. One subject! what could it be? Could he allude to an object
on whom I dared not even think?
“Compose yourself,” said Clerval, who observed my change of colour,
“I will not mention it, if it agitates you; but your father and cousin would
be very happy if they received a letter from you in your own hand-writing.
They hardly know how ill you have been, and are uneasy at your long
silence.”
“Is that all? my dear Henry. How could you suppose that my first
thought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love, and
who are so deserving of my love.”
“If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad to
see a letter that has been lying here some days for you: it is from your
cousin, I believe.”
CHAPTER V.
Clerval then put the following letter into my hands.
“To V. FRANKENSTEIN.
“MY DEAR COUSIN,
“I cannot describe to you the uneasiness we have all felt concerning your
health. We cannot help imagining that your friend Clerval conceals the
extent of your disorder: for it is now several months since we have seen
your hand-writing; and all this time you have been obliged to dictate your 
48 FRANKENSTEIN
letters to Henry. Surely, Victor, you must have been exceedingly ill; and
this makes us all very wretched, as much so nearly as after the death of
your dear mother. My uncle was almost persuaded that you were indeed
dangerously ill, and could hardly be restrained from undertaking a journey
to Ingolstadt. Clerval always writes that you are getting better; I eagerly
hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in your own hand-writing;
for indeed, indeed, Victor, we are all very miserable on this account. Relieve
us from this fear, and we shall be the happiest creatures in the world. Your
father’s health is now so vigorous, that he appears ten years younger since
last winter. Ernest also is so much improved, that you would hardly know
him: he is now nearly sixteen, and has lost that sickly appearance which
he had some years ago; he is grown quite robust and active.
“My uncle and I conversed a long time last night about what profession Ernest should follow. His constant illness when young has deprived
him of the habits of application; and now that he enjoys good health, he
is continually in the open air, climbing the hills, or rowing on the lake. I
therefore proposed that he should be a farmer; which you know, Cousin, is
a favourite scheme of mine. A farmer’s is a very healthy happy life; and the
least hurtful, or rather the most beneficial profession of any. My uncle had
an idea of his being educated as an advocate, that through his interest he
might become a judge. But, besides that he is not at all fitted for such an
occupation, it is certainly more creditable to cultivate the earth for the sustenance of man, than to be the confidant, and sometimes the accomplice, of
his vices; which is the profession of a lawyer. I said, that the employments
of a prosperous farmer, if they were not a more honourable, they were at
least a happier species of occupation than that of a judge, whose misfortune
it was always to meddle with the dark side of human nature. My uncle
smiled, and said, that I ought to be an advocate myself, which put an end
to the conversation on that subject.
“And now I must tell you a little story that will please, and perhaps
amuse you. Do you not remember Justine Moritz? Probably you do not;
I will relate her history, therefore, in a few words. Madame Moritz, her
mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the third.
This girl had always been the favourite of her father; but, through a strange
perversity, her mother could not endure her, and, after the death of M.
Moritz, treated her very ill. My aunt observed this; and, when Justine was
twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our
house. The republican institutions of our country have produced simpler
and happier manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies
that surround it. Hence there is less distinction between the several classes 
Volume I 49
of its inhabitants; and the lower orders being neither so poor nor so despised,
their manners are more refined and moral. A servant in Geneva does not
mean the same thing as a servant in France and England. Justine, thus
received in our family, learned the duties of a servant; a condition which,
in our fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance, and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.
“After what I have said, I dare say you well remember the heroine of
my little tale: for Justine was a great favourite of your’s; and I recollect
you once remarked, that if you were in an ill humour, one glance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that Ariosto gives concerning
the beauty of Angelica—she looked so frank-hearted and happy. My aunt
conceived a great attachment for her, by which she was induced to give her
an education superior to that which she had at first intended. This benefit
was fully repaid; Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world:
I do not mean that she made any professions, I never heard one pass her
lips; but you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.
Although her disposition was gay, and in many respects inconsiderate, yet
she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt. She thought
her the model of all excellence, and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.
“When my dearest aunt died, every one was too much occupied in their
own grief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness
with the most anxious affection. Poor Justine was very ill; but other trials
were reserved for her.
“One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the
exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless. The conscience of
the woman was troubled; she began to think that the deaths of her favourites was a judgment from heaven to chastise her partiality. She was a
Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor confirmed the idea which she
had conceived. Accordingly, a few months after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her repentant mother. Poor girl! she
wept when she quitted our house: she was much altered since the death
of my aunt; grief had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable for vivacity. Nor was her residence
at her mother’s house of a nature to restore her gaiety. The poor woman
was very vacillating in her repentance. She sometimes begged Justine to
forgive her unkindness, but much oftener accused her of having caused
the deaths of her brothers and sister. Perpetual fretting at length threw
Madame Moritz into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but
she is now at peace for ever. She died on the first approach of cold weather, 
50 FRANKENSTEIN
at the beginning of this last winter. Justine has returned to us; and I assure
you I love her tenderly. She is very clever and gentle, and extremely pretty;
as I mentioned before, her mien and her expressions continually remind
me of my dear aunt.
“I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling
William. I wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with sweet
laughing blue eyes, dark eye-lashes, and curling hair. When he smiles, two
little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with health. He has
already had one or two little wives, but Louisa Biron is his favourite, a
pretty little girl of five years of age.
“Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip concerning the good people of Geneva. The pretty Miss Mansfield has
already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage
with a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq. Her ugly sister, Manon,
married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn. Your favourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunes since the departure
of Clerval from Geneva. But he has already recovered his spirits, and is
reported to be on the point of marrying a very lively pretty Frenchwoman,
Madame Tavernier. She is a widow, and much older than Manoir; but she
is very much admired, and a favourite with every body.
“I have written myself into good spirits, dear cousin;54 yet I cannot conclude without again anxiously inquiring concerning your health. Dear Victor, if you are not very ill, write yourself, and make your father and all of
us happy; or——I cannot bear to think of the other side of the question; my
tears already flow. Adieu, my dearest cousin.
“ELIZABETH LAVENZA.
“Geneva, March 18th, 17—.”
“Dear, dear Elizabeth!” I exclaimed when I had read her letter, “I will
write instantly, and relieve them from the anxiety they must feel.” I wrote,
and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but my convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly. In another fortnight I was able to leave
my chamber.
54. Narrative reflection has transformative power—the process of writing one’s story can actually
change one’s understanding of the story. Because reflecting on and writing about an experience
can influence how a person feels about the experience, it is possible for Victor to “write himself”
into better spirits. Note in this regard that Mary does not at this point describe Victor as having
made any notes on his experiments, even for his private use, if not for publication. For more on
reflective writing, see Bolton 2014.

One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the
several professors of the university. In doing this, I underwent a kind of
rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained. Ever
since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural
philosophy.55 When I was otherwise quite restored to health, the sight of a
chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms.
Henry saw this, and had removed all my apparatus from my view. He had
also changed my apartment; for he perceived that I had acquired a dislike
for the room which had previously been my laboratory. But these cares
of Clerval were made of no avail when I visited the professors. M. Waldman inflicted torture when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the
astonishing progress I had made in the sciences. He soon perceived that I
disliked the subject; but, not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to modesty, and changed the subject from my improvement to the science itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out. What could
I do? He meant to please, and he tormented me. I felt as if he had placed
carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death. I writhed under his
words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt.56 Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the sensations of others, declined
the subject, alleging, in excuse, his total ignorance; and the conversation
took a more general turn. I thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not
speak. I saw plainly that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw
my secret from me; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection
and reverence that knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to
confide to him that event which was so often present to my recollection,
but which I feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply.
55. It is only in hindsight that Victor recognizes the consequences of engaging in unreflective
“natural philosophy” or scientific study. Had he seriously considered the ethical consequences
of making his creature, and had these considerations outweighed his hubris and desire for personal
success, it is unlikely he would have proceeded. This healthy fear of unchecked scientific progress
(that Victor develops too late) highlights the need for attention to the scientist’s personal and
professional development as well as the need for scientists to engage in self-reflection to consider
ethical issues before they commence scientific studies.
Nicole Piemonte.
56. Maintaining his secret and keeping positive human interactions cause Victor distress, but
his failure to have positive interactions with the creature causes the creature distress as well.
The challenge not to allow feelings to be visible in normal bodily reactions is immense. Cultural
systems see emotions as embodied. From shortly after birth, infants are able to read approval
and disapproval on their parents’ faces.

M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of
almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me
even more pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman. “D—n
the fellow!” cried he; “why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has outstript us all.
Aye, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true. A youngster who, but a
few years ago, believed Cornelius Agrippa as firmly as the gospel, has now
set himself at the head of the university; and if he is not soon pulled down,
we shall all be out of countenance.—Aye, aye,” continued he, observing
my face expressive of suffering, “M. Frankenstein is modest; an excellent
quality in a young man. Young men should be diffident of themselves, you
know, M. Clerval; I was myself when young: but that wears out in a very
short time.”
M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily
turned the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.
Clerval was no natural philosopher. His imagination was too vivid
for the minutiæ of science.57 Languages were his principal study; and he
sought, by acquiring their elements, to open a field for self-instruction on
his return to Geneva. Persian, Arabic, and Hebrew, gained his attention,
after he had made himself perfectly master of Greek and Latin. For my
own part, idleness had ever been irksome to me; and now that I wished to
fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt great relief in being
the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists. Their melancholy is soothing, and
their joy elevating to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors
of any other country. When you read their writings, life appears to consist
in a warm sun and garden of roses,—in the smiles and frowns of a fair
enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart. How different from the
manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome.
Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva
was fixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several accidents,
57. Victor’s observation about Clerval underscores the romantic interest in the problem of the
degree of imaginative power necessary to the arts versus the sciences. In Biographia literaria
(1817), Samuel Taylor Coleridge, for example, defines a difference between the active “imaginative”
act and the “fancy,” the recounting of a memory that may be altered or extended but that is always
passive. Clerval is described as having too much imagination for science because imagination is
defined in opposition to details. Yet earlier Victor has detailed his belief that his attraction to science
comes in part from its visionary quality (see p. 29). This apparent contradiction in Victor’s position,
which may be Mary’s way of showing the character’s limitations, remains unresolved. However,
it is notable that by the 1831 edition, this point about the imagination being too vivid for science had
been omitted (see “Introduction to Frankenstein [1831],” pp. 189–193).

winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable, and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring. I felt this delay very bitterly; for
I longed to see my native town, and my beloved friends. My return had only
been delayed so long from an unwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange
place, before he had become acquainted with any of its inhabitants. The
winter, however, was spent cheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came, its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness.
The month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter
daily which was to fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a
pedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt that I might bid a personal
farewell to the country I had so long inhabited. I acceded with pleasure to
this proposition: I was fond of exercise, and Clerval had always been my
favourite companion in the rambles of this nature that I had taken among
the scenes of my native country.
We passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spirits
had long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the salubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and the conversation of my friend. Study had before secluded me from the intercourse
of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but Clerval called forth
the better feelings of my heart; he again taught me to love the aspect of
nature, and the cheerful faces of children. Excellent friend! how sincerely
did you love me, and endeavour to elevate my mind, until it was on a level
with your own. A selfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your
gentleness and affection warmed and opened my senses; I became the
same happy creature who, a few years ago, loving and beloved by all, had
no sorrow or care. When happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most delightful sensations. A serene sky and verdant fields
filled me with ecstacy. The present season was indeed divine; the flowers
of spring bloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in
bud: I was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had
pressed upon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with
an invincible burden.
Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathized in my feelings:
he exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that
filled his soul. The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly astonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in imitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful fancy
and passion. At other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew me
out into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity.
54 FRANKENSTEIN
We returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were
dancing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy. My own spirits
were high, and I bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.
CHAPTER VI.
On my return, I found the following letter from my father: —
“To V. FRANKENSTEIN.
“MY DEAR VICTOR,
“You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your
return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few lines, merely
mentioning the day on which I should expect you. But that would be a cruel
kindness, and I dare not do it. What would be your surprise, my son, when
you expected a happy and gay welcome, to behold, on the contrary, tears
and wretchedness? And how, Victor, can I relate our misfortune? Absence
cannot have rendered you callous to our joys and griefs; and how shall I
inflict pain on an absent child? I wish to prepare you for the woeful news,
but I know it is impossible; even now your eye skims over the page, to seek
the words which are to convey to you the horrible tidings.
“William is dead!—that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed
my heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay! Victor, he is murdered!
“I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the circumstances of the transaction.
“Last Thursday (May 7th) I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to
walk in Plainpalais. The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged
our walk farther than usual. It was already dusk before we thought of
returning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone
on before, were not to be found. We accordingly rested on a seat until they
should return. Presently Ernest came, and inquired if we had seen his
brother: he said, that they had been playing together, that William had run
away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and afterwards
waited for him a long time, but that he did not return.
“This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him
until night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned
to the house. He was not there. We returned again, with torches; for I
could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had lost himself, and
was exposed to all the damps and dews of night: Elizabeth also suffered
extreme anguish. About five in the morning I discovered my lovely boy,
whom the night before I had seen blooming and active in health, stretched 
Volume I 55
on the grass livid and motionless: the print of the murderer’s finger was on
his neck.
“He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my countenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth. She was very earnest to see the
corpse. At first I attempted to prevent her; but she persisted, and entering
the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, ‘O God! I have murdered my darling infant!’
“She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she again
lived, it was only to weep and sigh. She told me, that that same evening
William had teazed her to let him wear a very valuable miniature that
she possessed of your mother. This picture is gone, and was doubtless the
temptation which urged the murderer to the deed. We have no trace of him
at present, although our exertions to discover him are unremitted; but they
will not restore my beloved William.
“Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth. She weeps continually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death; her words
pierce my heart. We are all unhappy; but will not that be an additional
motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter? Your dear mother!
Alas, Victor! I now say, Thank God she did not live to witness the cruel,
miserable death of her youngest darling!
“Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin,
but with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of festering the wounds of our minds. Enter the house of mourning, my friend, but
with kindness and affection for those who love you, and not with hatred for
your enemies.
“Your affectionate and afflicted father,
ALPHONSE FRANKENSTEIN.
“Geneva, May 12th, 17—.”
Clerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was
surprised to observe the despair that succeeded to the joy I at first expressed
on receiving news from my friends. I threw the letter on the table, and
covered my face with my hands.
“My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me weep
with bitterness, “are you always to be unhappy? My dear friend, what has
happened?”
I motioned to him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the
room in the extremest agitation. Tears also gushed from the eyes of Clerval,
as he read the account of my misfortune.
56 FRANKENSTEIN
“I can offer you no consolation, my friend,” said he; “your disaster is
irreparable. What do you intend to do.”
“To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses.”
During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to raise my spirits. He did not
do this by common topics of consolation, but by exhibiting the truest sympathy. “Poor William!” said he, “that dear child; he now sleeps with his
angel mother. His friends mourn and weep, but he is at rest: he does not
now feel the murderer’s grasp; a sod covers his gentle form, and he knows
no pain. He can no longer be a fit subject for pity; the survivors are the
greatest sufferers, and for them time is the only consolation. Those maxims
of the Stoics, that death was no evil, and that the mind of man ought to be
superior to despair on the eternal absence of a beloved object, ought not to
be urged. Even Cato wept over the dead body of his brother.”
Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words
impressed themselves on my mind, and I remembered them afterwards in
solitude. But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a cabriole,
and bade farewell to my friend.
My journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I
longed to console and sympathize with my loved and sorrowing friends; but
when I drew near my native town, I slackened my progress. I could hardly
sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. I passed
through scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly
six years. How altered every thing might be during that time? One sudden and desolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations which, although
they were done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive. Fear overcame me; I dared not advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that
made me tremble, although I was unable to define them.
I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind. I contemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm, and the
snowy mountains, “the palaces of nature,” were not changed. By degrees
the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey
towards Geneva.
The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I
approached my native town. I discovered more distinctly the black sides
of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc; I wept like a child: “Dear
mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome your wanderer?
Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and placid. Is this to
prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?”
Volume I 57
I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on
these preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative happiness, and I think of them with pleasure. My country, my beloved country!
who but a native can tell the delight I took in again beholding thy streams,
thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely lake.
Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. Night
also closed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I
felt still more gloomily. The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil,
and I foresaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched
of human beings. Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single
circumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.58
It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the
gates of the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night
at Secheron, a village half a league to the east of the city. The sky was
serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot where my
poor William had been murdered. As I could not pass through the town, I
was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais. During this
short voyage I saw the lightnings playing on the summit of Mont Blanc
in the most beautiful figures. The storm appeared to approach rapidly;
and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its progress. It
advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain coming slowly
in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.
I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm
increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over
my head. It was echoed from Salêve, the Juras, and the Alps of Savoy;
vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the lake, making it
58. Victor links his feelings of foreboding to the romantic notion of the sublime, combining that
era’s captivation with the immense beauty of the natural world with a perception of its dangers and
a willingness to entertain the possibility of personal annihilation. Just before this passage, Victor
speaks with tremendous affection and pride about the impressive mountains surrounding his home,
using the salutation “Dear” and the possessive pronoun phrase “my own.” However, in his encounter
with the sublime, he fails to achieve what philosopher Edmund Burke (1729–1797) called “sublime
transcendence,” which means to experience a sudden relief from horror. Because Victor views
the sublime from a position of great personal risk, he can see in this natural vista only his personal
suffering and ultimate destruction. This passage also highlights an essential contradiction in Victor’s
personality: he is both tremendously confident and self-effacing, both a director of his own fate and
a passive object at the mercy of uncontrollable forces. As with his renegade approach to scientific
discovery, here he simultaneously lauds his powers of prophesy and admits to their deficiencies.
Egoism, a flaw that greatly facilitates Victor’s hubris, also surfaces here with the repeated use of
the first-person pronoun I, used to emphasize both his vulnerability and his power.

58 FRANKENSTEIN
appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant every thing seemed of
a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself from the preceding flash.
The storm, as is often the case in Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The most violent storm hung exactly north of
the town, over that part of the lake which lies between the promontory
of Belrive and the village of Copêt. Another storm enlightened Jura with
faint flashes; and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the Môle, a
peaked mountain to the east of the lake.
While I watched the storm, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with
a hasty step. This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my
hands, and exclaimed aloud, “William, dear angel! this is thy funeral, this
thy dirge!” As I said these words, I perceived in the gloom a figure which
stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood fixed, gazing intently:
I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning illuminated the object, and
discovered its shape plainly to me; its gigantic stature, and the deformity
of its aspect, more hideous than belongs to humanity, instantly informed
me that it was the wretch, the filthy dæmon to whom I had given life. What
did he there? Could he be (I shuddered at the conception) the murderer of
my brother? No sooner did that idea cross my imagination, than I became
convinced of its truth; my teeth chattered, and I was forced to lean against
a tree for support.59 The figure passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom.
Nothing in human shape could have destroyed that fair child. He was the
murderer! I could not doubt it. The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact. I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have
been in vain, for another flash discovered him to me hanging among the
rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of Mont Salêve, a hill that bounds
Plainpalais on the South. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.
I remained motionless. The thunder ceased; but the rain still continued,
and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. I revolved in
my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget: the whole train
59. In Greek myth, Prometheus fashions the clay into which Athena, goddess of wisdom, breathes
life, creating the human race. Over the objections of Zeus, Prometheus then provides humans with
fire, an element essential for human life. Similarly, Victor uses electricity, a form of fire, to animate
his creation. Flashes of light recur throughout the novel, often leading to perceptions by Victor. He
continues to characterize the creature as physically “hideous,” which he equates with the demonic.
The latter is by nature found amid darkness and filth. Victor labors at times to balance what he sees
in dreams and what he sees in actual physical existence. Both, however, are for the romantic age
sources of knowledge. But having realized he is not simply observing a phantom in the glimpses he
catches of the creature, Victor immediately reacts to the “hideous” being as a demon. His realization
results in his bodily response of fear as his teeth chatter. (Contrast this interpretation with Charles
E. Robinson’s; see pp. xxii-xxxiii.)

Volume I 59
of my progress towards the creation; the appearance of the work of my
own hands alive at my bed side; its departure. Two years had now nearly
elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and was this his first
crime? Alas! I had turned loose into the world a depraved wretch, whose
delight was in carnage and misery; had he not murdered my brother?
No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the
night, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not feel the
inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in scenes of evil
and despair. I considered the being whom I had cast among mankind, and
endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror, such as the
deed which he had now done, nearly in the light of my own vampire, my own
spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to me.
Day dawned; and I directed my steps toward the town. The gates were
open; and I hastened to my father’s house. My first thought was to discover
what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be made. But
I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell. A being whom I
myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at midnight among
the precipices of an inaccessible mountain. I remembered also the nervous
fever with which I had been seized just at the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly
improbable. I well knew that if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have looked upon it as the ravings of insanity. Besides,
the strange nature of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so
far credited as to persuade my relatives to commence it. Besides, of what
use would be pursuit? Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the
overhanging sides of Mont Salêve? These reflections determined me, and I
resolved to remain silent.
It was about five in the morning when I entered my father’s house. I
told the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library to
attend their usual hour of rising.
Six years had elapsed, passed as a dream but for one indelible trace,
and I stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before
my departure for Ingolstadt. Beloved and respectable parent! He still
remained to me. I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the
mantle-piece. It was an historical subject, painted at my father’s desire,
and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling by the
coffin of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale; but there
was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the sentiment of
pity. Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my tears flowed
when I looked upon it. While I was thus engaged, Ernest entered: he had 
60 FRANKENSTEIN
heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me. He expressed a sorrowful
delight to see me: “Welcome, my dearest Victor,” said he. “Ah! I wish you
had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous
and delighted. But we are now unhappy; and, I am afraid, tears instead of
smiles will be your welcome. Our father looks so sorrowful: this dreadful
event seems to have revived in his mind his grief on the death of Mamma.
Poor Elizabeth also is quite inconsolable.” Ernest began to weep as he said
these words.
“Do not,” said I, “welcome me thus; try to be more calm, that I may not
be absolutely miserable the moment I enter my father’s house after so long
an absence. But, tell me, how does my father support his misfortunes? and
how is my poor Elizabeth?”
“She indeed requires consolation; she accused herself of having caused
the death of my brother, and that made her very wretched. But since the
murderer has been discovered——”
“The murderer discovered! Good God! how can that be? who could
attempt to pursue him? It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake
the winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw.”
“I do not know what you mean; but we were all very unhappy when she
was discovered. No one would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth
will not be convinced; notwithstanding all the evidence. Indeed, who would
credit that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family,
could all at once become so extremely wicked?”
“Justine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the accused? But it is wrongfully;
every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?”
“No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have
almost forced conviction upon us: and her own behaviour has been so confused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear, leaves no hope
for doubt. But she will be tried to-day, and you will then hear all.”
He related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William had
been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her bed; and,
after several days, one of the servants, happening to examine the apparel
she had worn on the night of the murder, had discovered in her pocket
the picture of my mother, which had been judged to be the temptation of
the murderer. The servant instantly shewed it to one of the others, who,
without saying a word to any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon
their deposition, Justine was apprehended. On being charged with the fact,
the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme
confusion of manner.
Volume I 61
This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied
earnestly, “You are all mistaken; I know the murderer. Justine, poor, good
Justine, is innocent.”
At that instant my father entered. I saw unhappiness deeply impressed
on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and,
after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced
some other topic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed,
“Good God, Papa! Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of poor
William.”
“We do also, unfortunately,” replied my father; “for indeed I had rather
have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and
ingratitude in one I valued so highly.”
“My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.”
“If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. She is to be tried
to-day, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.”
This speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind that
Justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder. I
had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be brought
forward strong enough to convict her; and, in this assurance, I calmed
myself, expecting the trial with eagerness, but without prognosticating an
evil result.
We were soon joined by Elizabeth. Time had made great alterations in
her form since I had last beheld her. Six years before she had been a pretty,
good-humoured girl, whom every one loved and caressed. She was now a
woman in stature and expression of countenance, which was uncommonly
lovely. An open and capacious forehead gave indications of a good understanding, joined to great frankness of disposition. Her eyes were hazel, and
expressive of mildness, now through recent affliction allied to sadness. Her
hair was of a rich dark auburn, her complexion fair, and her figure slight
and graceful. She welcomed me with the greatest affection. “Your arrival,
my dear cousin,” said she, “fills me with hope. You perhaps will find some
means to justify my poor guiltless Justine. Alas! who is safe, if she be convicted of crime? I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do upon my own.
Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely love, is to be torn away by even
a worse fate. If she is condemned, I never shall know joy more. But she will
not, I am sure she will not; and then I shall be happy again, even after the
sad death of my little William.”
“She is innocent, my Elizabeth,” said I, “and that shall be proved; fear
nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of her acquittal.”
62 FRANKENSTEIN
“How kind you are! every one else believes in her guilt, and that made
me wretched; for I knew that it was impossible: and to see every one else
prejudiced in so deadly a manner, rendered me hopeless and despairing.”
She wept.
“Sweet niece,” said my father, “dry your tears. If she is, as you believe,
innocent, rely on the justice of our judges, and the activity with which I
shall prevent the slightest shadow of partiality.”
CHAPTER VII.
We passed a few sad hours, until eleven o’clock, when the trial was to commence. My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend as witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the whole of this wretched
mockery of justice, I suffered living torture. It was to be decided, whether
the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would cause the death of two
of my fellow-beings: one a smiling babe, full of innocence and joy; the other
far more dreadfully murdered, with every aggravation of infamy that could
make the murder memorable in horror. Justine also was a girl of merit,
and possessed qualities which promised to render her life happy: now all
was to be obliterated in an ignominious grave; and I the cause! A thousand
times rather would I have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to
Justine; but I was absent when it was committed, and such a declaration
would have been considered as the ravings of a madman, and would not
have exculpated her who suffered through me.
The appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning;
and her countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of
her feelings, exquisitely beautiful. Yet she appeared confident in innocence,
and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by thousands; for all
the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have excited, was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the imagination of the enormity she
was supposed to have committed. She was tranquil, yet her tranquillity
was evidently constrained; and as her confusion had before been adduced
as a proof of her guilt, she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage. When she entered the court, she threw her eyes round it, and quickly
discovered where we were seated. A tear seemed to dim her eye when she
saw us; but she quickly recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection
seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness.
The trial began; and after the advocate against her had stated the
charge, several witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined
against her, which might have staggered any one who had not such proof 
Volume I 63
of her innocence as I had. She had been out the whole of the night on which
the murder had been committed, and towards morning had been perceived
by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the murdered
child had been afterwards found. The woman asked her what she did there;
but she looked very strangely, and only returned a confused and unintelligible answer. She returned to the house about eight o’clock; and when
one inquired where she had passed the night, she replied, that she had
been looking for the child, and demanded earnestly, if any thing had been
heard concerning him. When shewn the body, she fell into violent hysterics,
and kept her bed for several days. The picture was then produced, which
the servant had found in her pocket; and when Elizabeth, in a faltering
voice, proved that it was the same which, an hour before the child had been
missed, she had placed round his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.
Justine was called on for her defence. As the trial had proceeded, her
countenance had altered. Surprise, horror, and misery, were strongly
expressed. Sometimes she struggled with her tears; but when she was
desired to plead, she collected her powers, and spoke in an audible although
variable voice:—
“God knows,” she said, “how entirely I am innocent. But I do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me: I rest my innocence on a
plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced against
me; and I hope the character I have always borne will incline my judges to
a favourable interpretation, where any circumstance appears doubtful or
suspicious.”
She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed
the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed, at the
house of an aunt at Chêne, a village situated at about a league from Geneva.
On her return, at about nine o’clock, she met a man, who asked her if she
had seen any thing of the child who was lost. She was alarmed by this
account, and passed several hours in looking for him, when the gates of
Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain several hours of the night
in a barn belonging to a cottage, being unwilling to call up the inhabitants,
to whom she was well known. Unable to rest or sleep, she quitted her
asylum early, that she might again endeavour to find my brother. If she
had gone near the spot where his body lay, it was without her knowledge.
That she had been bewildered when questioned by the market-woman,
was not surprising, since she had passed a sleepless night, and the fate
of poor William was yet uncertain. Concerning the picture she could give
no account.
64 FRANKENSTEIN
“I know,” continued the unhappy victim, “how heavily and fatally this
one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of explaining it;
and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left to conjecture
concerning the probabilities by which it might have been placed in my
pocket. But here also I am checked. I believe that I have no enemy on earth,
and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly. Did
the murderer place it there? I know of no opportunity afforded him for so
doing; or if I had, why should he have stolen the jewel, to part with it again
so soon?
“I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for hope.
I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my character; and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt, I must
be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my innocence.”
Several witnesses were called, who had known her for many years, and
they spoke well of her; but fear, and hatred of the crime of which they supposed her guilty, rendered them timorous, and unwilling to come forward.
Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused, when, although violently
agitated, she desired permission to address the court.
“I am,” said she, “the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered, or
rather his sister, for I was educated by and have lived with his parents ever
since and even long before his birth. It may therefore be judged indecent
in me to come forward on this occasion; but when I see a fellow-creature
about to perish through the cowardice of her pretended friends, I wish to
be allowed to speak, that I may say what I know of her character. I am
well acquainted with the accused. I have lived in the same house with her,
at one time for five, and at another for nearly two years. During all that
period she appeared to me the most amiable and benevolent of human creatures. She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in her last illness with
the greatest affection and care; and afterwards attended her own mother
during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited the admiration of all
who knew her. After which she again lived in my uncle’s house, where she
was beloved by all the family. She was warmly attached to the child who is
now dead, and acted towards him like a most affectionate mother. For my
own part, I do not hesitate to say, that, notwithstanding all the evidence
produced against her, I believe and rely on her perfect innocence. She had
no temptation for such an action: as to the bauble on which the chief proof
rests, if she had earnestly desired it, I should have willingly given it to her;
so much do I esteem and value her.”
Volume I 65
Excellent Elizabeth! A murmur of approbation was heard; but it was
excited by her generous interference, and not in favour of poor Justine, on
whom the public indignation was turned with renewed violence, charging
her with the blackest ingratitude. She herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but
she did not answer. My own agitation and anguish was extreme during the
whole trial. I believed in her innocence; I knew it. Could the dæmon, who
had (I did not for a minute doubt) murdered my brother, also in his hellish sport have betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy. I could not
sustain the horror of my situation; and when I perceived that the popular voice, and the countenances of the judges, had already condemned my
unhappy victim, I rushed out of the court in agony. The tortures of the
accused did not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs
of remorse tore my bosom, and would not forego their hold.60
I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. In the morning I went to
the court; my lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask the fatal question; but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my visit. The
ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine was condemned.
I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I had before experienced
sensations of horror; and I have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the heart-sickening
despair that I then endured. The person to whom I addressed myself added,
that Justine had already confessed her guilt. “That evidence,” he observed,
“was hardly required in so glaring a case, but I am glad of it; and, indeed,
none of our judges like to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence,
be it ever so decisive.”
When I returned home, Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.
“My cousin,” replied I, “it is decided as you may have expected; all judges
had rather that ten innocent should suffer, than that one guilty should
escape. But she has confessed.”
This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness
upon Justine’s innocence. “Alas!” said she, “how shall I ever again believe
in human benevolence? Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as my sister,
60. The encounter between Justine and Elizabeth is filled with passion. Justine comes to accept
her execution, even if unjust, because she sees it as necessary for her ultimate salvation, and
Elizabeth, convinced now of Justine’s innocence, is relieved because her trust in Justine has not
been betrayed. Such feelings trump concerns for justice. By contrast, Victor’s anguish at the
injustice and his realization that it is his creation that committed the murder fill him with remorse,
an intense correlate of guilt. In current moral thinking, feeling and expressing remorse are
essential for seeking forgiveness. But Victor can only hold these feelings within himself because
he cannot disclose the truth about his efforts and their impact.

66 FRANKENSTEIN
how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray; her mild
eyes seemed incapable of any severity or ill-humour, and yet she has committed a murder.”
Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a wish to see my
cousin. My father wished her not to go; but said, that he left it to her own
judgment and feelings to decide. “Yes,” said Elizabeth, “I will go, although
she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany me: I cannot go alone.” The
idea of this visit was torture to me, yet I could not refuse.
We entered the gloomy prison-chamber, and beheld Justine sitting on
some straw at the further end; her hands were manacled, and her head
rested on her knees. She rose on seeing us enter; and when we were left
alone with her, she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly.
My cousin wept also.
“Oh, Justine!” said she, “why did you rob me of my last consolation. I
relied on your innocence; and although I was then very wretched, I was not
so miserable as I am now.”
“And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked? Do you also join
with my enemies to crush me?” Her voice was suffocated with sobs.
“Rise, my poor girl,” said Elizabeth, “why do you kneel, if you are innocent? I am not one of your enemies; I believed you guiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you had yourself declared your guilt.
That report, you say, is false; and be assured, dear Justine, that nothing
can shake my confidence in you for a moment, but your own confession.”
“I did confess; but I confessed a lie. I confessed, that I might obtain
absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than all my
other sins. The God of heaven forgive me! Ever since I was condemned,
my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced, until I almost
began to think that I was the monster that he said I was. He threatened
excommunication and hell fire in my last moments, if I continued obdurate.
Dear lady, I had none to support me; all looked on me as a wretch doomed
to ignominy and perdition. What could I do? In an evil hour I subscribed to
a lie; and now only am I truly miserable.”
She paused, weeping, and then continued—“I thought with horror, my
sweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom your blessed aunt
had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable of a
crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated. Dear William! dearest blessed child! I soon shall see you again in heaven, where we
shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as I am to suffer ignominy
and death.”
Volume I 67
“Oh, Justine! forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you. Why
did you confess? But do not mourn, my dear girl; I will every where proclaim your innocence, and force belief. Yet you must die; you, my playfellow, my companion, my more than sister. I never can survive so horrible a
misfortune.”
“Dear, sweet Elizabeth, do not weep. You ought to raise me with thoughts
of a better life, and elevate me from the petty cares of this world of injustice and strife. Do not you, excellent friend, drive me to despair.”
“I will try to comfort you; but this, I fear, is an evil too deep and poignant to admit of consolation, for there is no hope. Yet heaven bless thee,
my dearest Justine, with resignation, and a confidence elevated beyond
this world. Oh! how I hate its shews and mockeries! when one creature
is murdered, another is immediately deprived of life in a slow torturing
manner; then the executioners, their hands yet reeking with the blood of
innocence, believe that they have done a great deed. They call this retribution. Hateful name!61 When that word is pronounced, I know greater
and more horrid punishments are going to be inflicted than the gloomiest
tyrant has ever invented to satiate his utmost revenge. Yet this is not consolation for you, my Justine, unless indeed that you may glory in escaping
from so miserable a den. Alas! I would I were in peace with my aunt and
my lovely William, escaped from a world which is hateful to me, and the
visages of men which I abhor.”
61. This passage reflects the type of justice known as retributive, which relies on punishment to
balance the wrong done to the victim and his or her family and to act as a deterrent to others from
future acts of wrong-doing. In this worldview, justice is served when someone pays for the suffering caused to another. Mary is warning the reader that a rush to judgment, especially if revenge is
the driving motive, might hurt innocent people, creating a new form of injustice. This is what happens when the innocent Justine is wrongly executed for the death of William. Science and technology are also implicated in the apparatus of crime and punishment in a number of ways, including
the creation of various tools of execution, such as the guillotine—which was a terrible new invention at the time of the French Revolution—the electric chair, lethal injections, and so on. In modern
capital punishment in the United States, medical personnel are present to verify the prisoner’s
death, and psychiatrists play a role in determining whether someone is mentally healthy enough to
stand trial or if there are mitigating circumstances due to mental defect. Fingerprinting, handwriting analysis, DNA testing, and other forensic sciences have had disputatious histories, both in
terms of how they have been received as evidence in the courtroom and how they have called on
courts to understand scientific evidence. Scientific studies have also cast light on the fallibility of
eyewitness testimony, and many convictions have been overturned by exculpatory DNA evidence.
The power of forensic evidence is such in the public imagination, however, that a “CSI effect”—
named after the popular television show about crime scene investigators using high-tech forensic
analysis—has been identified in jurors who want to see scientific evidence of guilt even if those
scientific standards are derived from fiction.

Justine smiled languidly. “This, dear lady, is despair, and not resignation. I must not learn the lesson that you would teach me. Talk of something
else, something that will bring peace, and not increase of misery.”
During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison-room,
where I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me. Despair! Who
dared talk of that? The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass the
dreary boundary between life and death, felt not as I did, such deep and
bitter agony. I gnashed my teeth, and ground them together, uttering a
groan that came from my inmost soul. Justine started. When she saw who
it was, she approached me, and said, “Dear Sir, you are very kind to visit
me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty.”
I could not answer. “No, Justine,” said Elizabeth; “he is more convinced
of your innocence than I was; for even when he heard that you had confessed, he did not credit it.”
“I truly thank him. In these last moments I feel the sincerest gratitude
towards those who think of me with kindness. How sweet is the affection of
others to such a wretch as I am! It removes more than half my misfortune;
and I feel as if I could die in peace, now that my innocence is acknowledged
by you, dear lady, and your cousin.”
Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. She indeed
gained the resignation she desired. But I, the true murderer, felt the neverdying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or consolation.
Elizabeth also wept, and was unhappy; but her’s also was the misery of
innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair moon, for a while
hides, but cannot tarnish its brightness. Anguish and despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within me, which nothing
could extinguish. We staid several hours with Justine; and it was with
great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear herself away. “I wish,” cried she,
“that I were to die with you; I cannot live in this world of misery.”
Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty
repressed her bitter tears. She embraced Elizabeth, and said, in a voice
of half-suppressed emotion, “Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth, my
beloved and only friend; may heaven in its bounty bless and preserve you;
may this be the last misfortune that you will ever suffer. Live, and be
happy, and make others so.”
As we returned, Elizabeth said, “You know not, my dear Victor, how
much I am relieved, now that I trust in the innocence of this unfortunate
girl. I never could again have known peace, if I had been deceived in my
reliance on her. For the moment that I did believe her guilty, I felt an
anguish that I could not have long sustained. Now my heart is lightened. 
Volume I 69
The innocent suffers; but she whom I thought amiable and good has not
betrayed the trust I reposed in her, and I am consoled.”
Amiable cousin! such were your thoughts, mild and gentle as your own
dear eyes and voice. But I—I was a wretch, and none ever conceived of the
misery that I then endured.

VOL. II
CHAPTER I.
Nothing is more painful to the human mind, than, after the feelings have
been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of inaction and certainty which follows, and deprives the soul both of hope and
fear. Justine died; she rested; and I was alive. The blood flowed freely in
my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my heart, which
nothing could remove. Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered like an evil
spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond description horrible,
and more, much more, (I persuaded myself) was yet behind.1
 Yet my heart
overflowed with kindness, and the love of virtue. I had begun life with
benevolent intentions, and thirsted for the moment when I should put
them in practice, and make myself useful to my fellow-beings. Now all
was blasted: instead of that serenity of conscience, which allowed me to
look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and from thence to gather
promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and the sense of guilt, which
hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures, such as no language can
describe.2
This state of mind preyed upon my health, which had entirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained. I shunned the face of man; all
sound of joy or complacency was torture to me; solitude was my only consolation—deep, dark, death-like solitude.
1. The concept of guilt may well be a bit more complicated than it first appears. The two most
common understandings of guilt are at work in the text, prompting us to think about the idea of
guilt in relation to both Victor and the creature. First, guilt describes the person who is responsible
for an act that is unethical or illegal or both. Second, guilt describes the feelings that arise after
an act—feelings that can be said to haunt a person and potentially shape his or her future actions.
The second understanding of guilt is clarified by psychoanalytic thought, which theorizes that
guilt can be at work even when a person does not consciously attribute his or her actions to its
effects. For more on this understanding, see Sigmund Freud, Civilization and Its Discontents [1930]
1961. Freud’s arguments about the inextricable link between guilt and civilization make for a
fascinating parallel to Frankenstein.
In the first understanding, guilt is also attributed to a person for failing to do what he or she
believes is required in a situation. For example, Victor could be seen as guilty for his failure to
make the creature’s existence public, especially at the trial of Justine. As Shakespeare has Claudius
say in Hamlet, “[M]y stronger guilt defeats my strong intent” (III.iii.44).
Later in the novel, Victor makes a universal claim about the consequences of guilt: “Ah! it is well
for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for the guilty there is no peace” (p. 158).
Ramsey Eric Ramsey.
2. The interior anguish Victor experiences is given heightened expression here. Language has
limitations, and Victor finds he cannot disclose his interior conflicts. He has a tortured conscience.
Intense sensations of remorse and guilt disrupt his efforts to achieve and maintain a serene
conscience, a sense of being right. No words can express the hell and torture he is feeling.
Joel Gereboff.
72 FRANKENSTEIN
My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition and habits, and endeavoured to reason with me on the folly of giving
way to immoderate grief. “Do you think, Victor,” said he, “that I do not suffer also? No one could love a child more than I loved your brother”; (tears
came into his eyes as he spoke); “but is it not a duty to the survivors, that
we should refrain from augmenting their unhappiness by an appearance
of immoderate grief? It is also a duty owed to yourself; for excessive sorrow
prevents improvement or enjoyment, or even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for society.”
This advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I should
have been the first to hide my grief, and console my friends, if remorse
had not mingled its bitterness with my other sensations. Now I could only
answer my father with a look of despair, and endeavour to hide myself
from his view.
About this time we retired to our house at Belrive. This change was
particularly agreeable to me. The shutting of the gates regularly at ten
o’clock, and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that hour, had
rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome to me. I was
now free. Often, after the rest of the family had retired for the night, I
took the boat, and passed many hours upon the water. Sometimes, with my
sails set, I was carried by the wind; and sometimes, after rowing into the
middle of the lake, I left the boat to pursue its own course, and gave way to
my own miserable reflections. I was often tempted, when all was at peace
around me, and I the only unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene
so beautiful and heavenly, if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh
and interrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore—
often, I say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters
might close over me and my calamities for ever. But I was restrained, when
I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly loved, and
whose existence was bound up in mine. I thought also of my father, and
surviving brother: should I by my base desertion leave them exposed and
unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose among them?3
3. Victor again feels guilt about not disclosing the existence of the destructive creature that he
has created. Yet he continues to fail to recognize and concede that his treatment and desertion of
the creature, not the initial creation, have brought about the destruction. In this instance, Victor
does sense the potential impact of his desertion on his family and others but remains blind to his
earlier desertion of his own creation.
Joel Gereboff.
Volume II 73
At these moments I wept bitterly, and wished that peace would revisit
my mind only that I might afford them consolation and happiness. But
that could not be. Remorse extinguished every hope. I had been the author
of unalterable evils; and I lived in daily fear, lest the monster whom I had
created should perpetrate some new wickedness.4
 I had an obscure feeling
that all was not over, and that he would still commit some signal crime,
which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past.
There was always scope for fear, so long as any thing I loved remained
behind. My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived. When I thought of
him, I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished
to extinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed. When I
reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds
of moderation. I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the
Andes, could I, when there, have precipitated him to their base. I wished to
see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of anger on his head,
and avenge the deaths of William and Justine.
Our house was the house of mourning. My father’s health was deeply
shaken by the horror of the recent events. Elizabeth was sad and desponding;
she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all pleasure seemed
to her sacrilege towards the dead; eternal woe and tears she then thought
was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted and destroyed.
4. The remorse Victor expresses is reminiscent of J. Robert Oppenheimer’s sentiments when
he witnessed the unspeakable power of the atomic bomb. A passage from the Hindu scripture
of the Bhagavad-Gita flashed before Oppenheimer’s mind: “I am become death, the destroyer
of worlds.” In this short phrase, Oppenheimer, as one of the architects of the A-bomb, acknowledged that he had unleashed a force that could lead to the annihilation of civilization. He also
proclaimed, “The physicists have known sin, and this is a knowledge they cannot lose” (qtd. in
Bird and Sherwin 2005, 388).
Victor’s responsibility for his horrific scientific experiment has already passed. It appears
that the creature is beyond control. All that is left is remorse. Oppenheimer, who witnessed a test
of the atomic bomb at Los Alamos in 1945, still had an opportunity to prevent the use of the
bomb against humans. Also see Heather E. Douglas’s essay “The Bitter Aftertaste of Technical
Sweetness” in this volume.
Scientists’ responsibility must be engaged before their creations are unleashed; otherwise,
the consequences cannot be retracted. Those scientists with high moral conscience view their
responsibility to warn about the malevolent uses of scientific results to their students, to their
colleagues, and to the public. They would cease and desist from scientific research that has no
redeeming value but destruction or baneful dehumanization. Victor’s anguish is a warning to
those scientists who bracket away the moral quality of their work under a banner of pure inquiry,
whatever its outcome. Whether it is cloning a human being, creating a new biological weapon,
releasing transgenic species, or designing human genomes, these ends call out for acts and
acknowledgments of social responsibility.

She was no longer that happy creature, who in earlier youth wandered
with me on the banks of the lake, and talked with ecstacy of our future
prospects. She had become grave, and often conversed of the inconstancy
of fortune, and the instability of human life.5
“When I reflect, my dear cousin,” said she, “on the miserable death
of Justine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they before
appeared to me. Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice,
that I read in books or heard from others, as tales of ancient days, or imaginary evils; at least they were remote, and more familiar to reason than
to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men appear to
me as monsters thirsting for each other’s blood. Yet I am certainly unjust.
Every body believed that poor girl to be guilty; and if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly she would have been
the most depraved of human creatures. For the sake of a few jewels, to
have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend, a child whom she had
nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if it had been her own! I
could not consent to the death of any human being; but certainly I should
have thought such a creature unfit to remain in the society of men. Yet she
was innocent.6
 I know, I feel she was innocent; you are of the same opinion,
and that confirms me. Alas! Victor, when falsehood can look so like the
truth, who can assure themselves of certain happiness?7
 I feel as if I were
5. After the death of Justine Moritz, Elizabeth is confronted with the unpredictability and temporality
of life—that is, the awareness that life is forever changing and moving forward even when its
trajectory is one we would never choose for ourselves. In contrast to Victor, who at least initially
was preoccupied with notions of fate and destiny, Elizabeth cannot help but see the world as
unjust and capricious (see note 11 on existentialism, p. 80 in this volume).

6. The nature of truth has been debated by philosophers throughout human history. Difficult
decisions about truth or deceit are often made by finding a set of facts to support a preexisting
belief. In the legal system, the accused can be convicted based on circumstantial evidence that later
turns out to be either patently false or unreliable or full of gaping holes (the Innocence Project
is a nonprofit organization that focuses on overturning convictions in such cases). Justine’s fate is
decided by just that type of evidence. In scientific endeavors, determining what is true from
research results likewise requires ensuring that any analysis is independent of personal biases.
Mary Drago.
7. Mary presupposes a direct relationship between knowing the truth and experiencing happiness,
though many other works of science fiction suggest otherwise. The Matrix (Lana Wachowski
and Lilly Wachowski, 1999) presented a generation of movie-goers with a choice between uncomfortable truths and blissful ignorance: “You take the blue pill, the story ends. You wake up in
your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland,
and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.” One reading of Victor’s behavior is his desperate
attempt to cling to something like happiness in the face of an increasingly dangerous truth.

walking on the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding,
and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss. William and Justine were
assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free,
and perhaps respected. But even if I were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places with such a wretch.”8
I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony. I, not in deed, but
in effect, was the true murderer. Elizabeth read my anguish in my countenance, and kindly taking my hand said, “My dearest cousin, you must calm
yourself. These events have affected me, God knows how deeply; but I am
not so wretched as you are. There is an expression of despair, and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance, that makes me tremble. Be calm,
my dear Victor; I would sacrifice my life to your peace. We surely shall be
happy: quiet in our native country, and not mingling in the world, what can
disturb our tranquillity?”
She shed tears as she said this, distrusting the very solace that she
gave; but at the same time she smiled, that she might chase away the fiend
that lurked in my heart. My father, who saw in the unhappiness that was
painted in my face only an exaggeration of that sorrow which I might naturally feel, thought that an amusement suited to my taste would be the
best means of restoring to me my wonted serenity. It was from this cause
that he had removed to the country; and, induced by the same motive, he
now proposed that we should all make an excursion to the valley of Chamounix. I had been there before, but Elizabeth and Ernest never had; and
both had often expressed an earnest desire to see the scenery of this place,
which had been described to them as so wonderful and sublime. Accordingly we departed from Geneva on this tour about the middle of the month
of August, nearly two months after the death of Justine.
The weather was uncommonly fine; and if mine had been a sorrow to be
chased away by any fleeting circumstance, this excursion would certainly
have had the effect intended by my father. As it was, I was somewhat interested in the scene; it sometimes lulled, although it could not extinguish my
grief. During the first day we travelled in a carriage. In the morning we had
seen the mountains at a distance, towards which we gradually advanced. We
perceived that the valley through which we wound, and which was formed
8. This ironic passage speaks of the reality that what appears to be true or what people take to
be true is often false. Elizabeth recognizes and expresses to Victor Justine’s innocence and the
injustice that has been done. But it is in fact Victor’s inability to profess the truth about the creature,
the murderer, that is the greatest lie. Society can maintain its emotional and moral equilibrium so
long as someone has “paid for a crime,” even when that person is innocent.

by the river Arve, whose course we followed, closed in upon us by degrees;
and when the sun had set, we beheld immense mountains and precipices
overhanging us on every side, and heard the sound of the river raging
among rocks, and the dashing of waterfalls around.
The next day we pursued our journey upon mules; and as we ascended
still higher, the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character. Ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains; the
impetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from
among the trees, formed a scene of singular beauty. But it was augmented
and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and shining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another earth, the habitations of another race of beings.
We passed the bridge of Pelissier, where the ravine, which the river forms,
opened before us, and we began to ascend the mountain that overhangs it.
Soon after we entered the valley of Chamounix. This valley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful and picturesque as that of Servox,
through which we had just passed. The high and snowy mountains were its
immediate boundaries; but we saw no more ruined castles and fertile fields.
Immense glaciers approached the road; we heard the rumbling thunder of
the falling avalanche, and marked the smoke of its passage. Mont Blanc, the
supreme and magnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding
aiguilles, and its tremendous dome overlooked the valley.
During this journey, I sometimes joined Elizabeth, and exerted myself
to point out to her the various beauties of the scene. I often suffered my
mule to lag behind, and indulged in the misery of reflection. At other times
I spurred on the animal before my companions, that I might forget them,
the world, and, more than all, myself. When at a distance, I alighted, and
threw myself on the grass, weighed down by horror and despair. At eight
in the evening I arrived at Chamounix. My father and Elizabeth were very
much fatigued; Ernest, who accompanied us, was delighted, and in high
spirits: the only circumstance that detracted from his pleasure was the
south wind, and the rain it seemed to promise for the next day.
We retired early to our apartments, but not to sleep; at least I did not.
I remained many hours at the window, watching the pallid lightning that
played above Mont Blanc, and listening to the rushing of the Arve, which
ran below my window.
CHAPTER II.
The next day, contrary to the prognostications of our guides, was fine,
although clouded. We visited the source of the Arveiron, and rode about 
Volume II 77
the valley until evening. These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded
me the greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving. They elevated
me from all littleness of feeling; and although they did not remove my grief,
they subdued and tranquillized it.9
 In some degree, also, they diverted my
mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the last month. I
returned in the evening, fatigued, but less unhappy, and conversed with
my family with more cheerfulness than had been my custom for some
time. My father was pleased, and Elizabeth overjoyed. “My dear cousin,”
said she, “you see what happiness you diffuse when you are happy; do not
relapse again!”
The following morning the rain poured down in torrents, and thick mists
hid the summits of the mountains. I rose early, but felt unusually melancholy. The rain depressed me; my old feelings recurred, and I was miserable. I knew how disappointed my father would be at this sudden change,
and I wished to avoid him until I had recovered myself so far as to be
enabled to conceal those feelings that overpowered me. I knew that they
would remain that day at the inn; and as I had ever inured myself to rain,
moisture, and cold, I resolved to go alone to the summit of Montanvert. I
remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous and ever-moving
glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it. It had then filled
me with a sublime ecstacy that gave wings to the soul, and allowed it to
soar from the obscure world to light and joy. The sight of the awful and
majestic in nature had indeed always the effect of solemnizing my mind,
and causing me to forget the passing cares of life. I determined to go alone,
9. The idea that exposure to nature (or “scenery”) produces unique psychological and spiritual
benefits was a common sentiment in romantic literary and artistic circles in the nineteenth century.
Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–1882) and Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862), both part of the tradition of American romanticism known as transcendentalism, celebrated in their writings the value of
a life lived close to nature, especially its salutary effect on the poetic and moral imagination. This
romantic notion of nature as “balm” would also influence the rise of the urban parks movement,
most notably via the work of landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted (1822–1903) in the mid–
nineteenth century. Olmsted’s plan for Manhattan’s Central Park, for example, was premised on the
idea that contemplation of natural scenery had a therapeutic effect on city dwellers. (This view
endures today in the concept of “biophilia,” the idea that humans are genetically predisposed to love
nature and need regular contact with it to thrive.) The romantic understanding of the value of natural scenery was bound up with a pair of distinct aesthetic categories: the “sublime,” which referred
to feelings of awe and even fear in the face of nature’s power and wildness, and the “picturesque,”
which described the contemplative reaction to a more orderly and human-scaled natural landscape
(e.g., the garden motif shaping Olmsted’s Central Park design). The notion of the sublime would
play a major role in American wilderness appreciation (and eventually protection) throughout the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries, animating the work of a diverse community of artists, writers,
and advocates, including Albert Bierstadt (1830–1902), John Muir (1838–1914), Ansel Adams
(1902–1984), and David Brower (1912–2000).

for I was well acquainted with the path, and the presence of another would
destroy the solitary grandeur of the scene.
The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short
windings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the mountain. It is a scene terrifically desolate. In a thousand spots the traces of the
winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie broken and strewed
on the ground; some entirely destroyed, others bent, leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain, or transversely upon other trees. The path, as
you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines of snow, down which stones
continually roll from above; one of them is particularly dangerous, as the
slightest sound, such as even speaking in a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw destruction upon the head of the speaker.
The pines are not tall or luxuriant, but they are sombre, and add an air of
severity to the scene. I looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising
from the rivers which ran through it, and curling in thick wreaths around
the opposite mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds
while rain poured from the dark sky, and added to the melancholy impression I received from the objects around me. Alas! why does man boast of
sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders them
more necessary beings. If our impulses were confined to hunger, thirst, and
desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by every wind that
blows, and a chance word or scene that that wind may convey to us.
We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.
We rise; one wand’ring thought pollutes the day.
We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh, or weep,
Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;
It is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow,
The path of its departure still is free.
Man’s yesterday may ne’er be like his morrow;
Nought may endure but mutability!10
10. Elizabeth attempts to console Victor with the thought of returning to live together in Geneva,
unchanging and undisturbed in their peace and bliss. Mary borrows a verse from her husband, Percy,
to remind us that this is a fool’s errand. Nostalgia for a past both perfect and peaceful is a product
of willful forgetting. First, we must forget all those elements of the past that were not peaceful and
perfect. Our memory of the past is edited to make it seem preferable to the uncertainties of the
present and future. Second, we must make ourselves forget that we are part of a system governed
by change in net linear direction. The long arc of history bends toward change, and it is not possible
to remove from the world the science and technology we have already introduced and thus return
the world to a peaceful but primeval state. It is, therefore, incumbent upon scientists and engineers
to think about how their work is embodied in the world and how the world is changed as a result.

It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent. For some
time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. A mist covered both
that and the surrounding mountains. Presently a breeze dissipated the
cloud, and I descended upon the glacier. The surface is very uneven, rising
like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and interspersed by rifts
that sink deep. The field of ice is almost a league in width, but I spent
nearly two hours in crossing it. The opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. From the side where I now stood Montanvert was exactly
opposite, at the distance of a league; and above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful
majesty. I remained in a recess of the rock, gazing on this wonderful and
stupendous scene. The sea, or rather the vast river of ice, wound among
its dependent mountains, whose aerial summits hung over its recesses.
Their icy and glittering peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds. My
heart, which was before sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy;
I exclaimed—“Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in
your narrow beds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion, away from the joys of life.”
As I said this, I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance,
advancing towards me with superhuman speed. He bounded over the crevices in the ice, among which I had walked with caution; his stature also, as
he approached, seemed to exceed that of man. I was troubled: a mist came
over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me; but I was quickly restored
by the cold gale of the mountains. I perceived, as the shape came nearer,
(sight tremendous and abhorred!) that it was the wretch whom I had created. I trembled with rage and horror, resolving to wait his approach, and
then close with him in mortal combat. He approached; his countenance
bespoke bitter anguish, combined with disdain and malignity, while its
unearthly ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes. But I
scarcely observed this; anger and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance, and I recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious detestation and contempt.
“Devil!” I exclaimed, “do you dare approach me? and do not you fear
the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head? Begone,
vile insect! or rather stay, that I may trample you to dust! and, oh, that I
could, with the extinction of your miserable existence, restore those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered!”
“I expected this reception,” said the dæmon. “All men hate the wretched;
how then must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all living things!
Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature, to whom thou art
bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of one of us. You purpose 
80 FRANKENSTEIN
to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life? Do your duty towards me,
and I will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind. If you will comply
with my conditions, I will leave them and you at peace; but if you refuse,
I will glut the maw of death, until it be satiated with the blood of your
remaining friends.”
“Abhorred monster! fiend that thou art! the tortures of hell are too mild
a vengeance for thy crimes. Wretched devil! you reproach me with your
creation; come on then, that I may extinguish the spark which I so negligently bestowed.”
My rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the feelings which can arm one being against the existence of another.
He easily eluded me, and said,
“Be calm! I entreat you to hear me, before you give vent to your hatred
on my devoted head. Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to increase
my misery? Life, although it may only be an accumulation of anguish, is
dear to me, and I will defend it.11 Remember, thou hast made me more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine; my joints more supple.
But I will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee. I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king, if thou
wilt also perform thy part, the which thou owest me. Oh, Frankenstein,
be not equitable to every other, and trample upon me alone, to whom thy
justice, and even thy clemency and affection, is most due. Remember, that
I am thy creature: I ought to be thy Adam; but I am rather the fallen angel,
whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed. Every where I see bliss, from
which I alone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery
made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.”
“Begone! I will not hear you. There can be no community between you
and me; we are enemies. Begone, or let us try our strength in a fight, in
which one must fall.”
11. Though this work well predates such existential writers as Albert Camus (1913–1960) and
John Paul Sartre (1905–1980), Mary’s narrative grapples with many of the same issues, including
feelings of anguish and meaninglessness, especially in the face of suffering and human finitude.
Much like the existentialists, who acknowledged the absurdity of making sense of life in a godless
world, Victor’s creation lives a life full of anguish and isolation, and he has no creator to whom he
can turn for answers or consolation. And yet the creation still sees life as “dear” and chooses to
“defend it” in spite of this endless misery, a point echoed by the existentialists nearly a century later,
who emphasized both the absurdity and the beauty in choosing to continue to live in the face of
suffering. Mere existence, in this sense, becomes a form of resistance or rebellion against meaninglessness and our unyielding trajectory toward death. For more on existentialism, see Aho 2014.

“How can I move thee? Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a favourable
eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and compassion? Believe
me, Frankenstein: I was benevolent; my soul glowed with love and humanity: but am I not alone, miserably alone? You, my creator, abhor me; what
hope can I gather from your fellow-creatures, who owe me nothing? they
spurn and hate me. The desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge. I have wandered here many days; the caves of ice, which I only do not
fear, are a dwelling to me, and the only one which man does not grudge.
These bleak skies I hail, for they are kinder to me than your fellow-beings.
If the multitude of mankind knew of my existence, they would do as you
do, and arm themselves for my destruction. Shall I not then hate them
who abhor me? I will keep no terms with my enemies. I am miserable, and
they shall share my wretchedness.12 Yet it is in your power to recompense
me, and deliver them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so
great, that not only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be
swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage. Let your compassion be moved,
and do not disdain me. Listen to my tale: when you have heard that, abandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge that I deserve. But hear me.
The guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they may be, to speak in
their own defence before they are condemned. Listen to me, Frankenstein.
You accuse me of murder; and yet you would, with a satisfied conscience,
destroy your own creature. Oh, praise the eternal justice of man!13 Yet I
ask you not to spare me: listen to me; and then, if you can, and if you will,
destroy the work of your hands.”
12. Here we see a classic way the “other” is constructed. The creature, an outcast from human
society, begs Victor to hear his story and see things from his, the other’s, perspective. He asks, in
essence, to be recognized as human. And yet, anticipating rejection, the creature also proclaims
his hatred for the humans who can grant him this recognition. This profound ambivalence is in
a sense at the core of otherness. The other, as critics from Franz Fanon to Gayatri Spivak have
argued, has a split within himself, a wound at the heart of his selfhood. He knows who he is, and
yet in the eyes of his fellow humans he sees only the monster they imagine him to be. In this
scene, it is also important to consider that the creature’s perspective is presented by Victor himself.
As readers, we cannot truly know the creature, nor will we ever know what he actually says. We
have only Walton’s version of Victor’s version of the creature’s story. It’s possible that Victor simply
wants us to believe that the creature hates humanity and so has chosen to include only the most
terrifying and vengeful statements that the creature makes. Again, this is what it means to construct an other. The truth of the other’s experience is barred from us because we have access to it
only through representations created by a society that has rejected that other.
Annalee Newitz.
13. The concept of murder functions like a central litmus test here and throughout the novel.
On the one hand, if you see Victor’s creation as a person, then Victor is countenancing murder as he
seeks to destroy his creation. Indeed, it would become very difficult to make a moral distinction
between Victor and the creature if this were the case. On the other hand, if the creature is a beast, 
82 FRANKENSTEIN
“Why do you call to my remembrance circumstances of which I shudder
to reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and author? Cursed be the
day, abhorred devil, in which you first saw light! Cursed (although I curse
myself) be the hands that formed you! You have made me wretched beyond
expression. You have left me no power to consider whether I am just to you,
or not. Begone! relieve me from the sight of your detested form.”
“Thus I relieve thee, my creator,” he said, and placed his hated hands
before my eyes, which I flung from me with violence; “thus I take from thee
a sight which you abhor. Still thou canst listen to me, and grant me thy
compassion. By the virtues that I once possessed, I demand this from you.
Hear my tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature of this place is
not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon the mountain. The
sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends to hide itself behind yon
snowy precipices, and illuminate another world, you will have heard my
story, and can decide. On you it rests, whether I quit for ever the neighbourhood of man, and lead a harmless life, or become the scourge of your
fellow-creatures, and the author of your own speedy ruin.”
As he said this, he led the way across the ice: I followed. My heart was
full, and I did not answer him; but, as I proceeded, I weighed the various
arguments that he had used, and determined at least to listen to his tale. I
was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my resolution. I
had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my brother, and I eagerly
sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion. For the first time, also, I felt
what the duties of a creator towards his creature were, and that I ought to
render him happy before I complained of his wickedness. These motives urged
me to comply with his demand. We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended
the opposite rock. The air was cold, and the rain again began to descend: we
entered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy heart, and
depressed spirits. But I consented to listen; and, seating myself by the fire
which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began his tale.
a piece of property, or a daemon (as Victor often calls him), then it is not possible to murder him
because he is not a person. During slavery, this question arose on a number of occasions.
Could an owner be prosecuted for murdering a piece of property? The question was highly politicized because to charge an owner with murdering a slave would be to acknowledge the slave’s
humanity and thus to call into question the entire institution of slavery. Even if the creature in
Mary’s tale is not human, however, his destruction may still have moral implications for other
reasons, but Victor would not be guilty of murder, and the creature would have committed a crime
Victor was himself not guilty of. Mary appears to have anticipated by two centuries one of the
central ethical concerns of robotics and artificial intelligence. How sophisticated would an artificial
intelligence have to be before it could be murdered? If it can be murdered, do we then have to
face the issue of its enslavement?

CHAPTER III.
“It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original æra of my
being: all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct. A strange
multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard, and smelt, at
the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I learned to distinguish
between the operations of my various senses.14 By degrees, I remember, a
stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I was obliged to shut my
eyes. Darkness then came over me, and troubled me; but hardly had I
felt this, when, by opening my eyes, as I now suppose, the light poured in
upon me again. I walked, and, I believe, descended; but I presently found a
great alteration in my sensations. Before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my touch or sight; but I now found that I could
wander on at liberty, with no obstacles which I could not either surmount
or avoid. The light became more and more oppressive to me; and, the heat
wearying me as I walked, I sought a place where I could receive shade.
This was the forest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook
resting from my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst. This
roused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I
found hanging on the trees, or lying on the ground. I slaked my thirst at
the brook; and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.
“It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half-frightened as it
were instinctively, finding myself so desolate. Before I had quitted your
apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some clothes;
but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night. I was a
poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could distinguish, nothing;
but, feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat down and wept.
“Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens, and gave me a sensation
of pleasure. I started up, and beheld a radiant form rise from among the
trees. I gazed with a kind of wonder. It moved slowly, but it enlightened
my path; and I again went out in search of berries. I was still cold, when
under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, with which I covered myself,
14. Although there are separate processing centers in the brain for the various senses, the pattern
of how each of these centers processes information is similar. For example, the somatosensory
cortex is the area of the brain where touch is processed. Here, different groups of neurons correspond
to touch on different parts of the body. Likewise, in the auditory cortex, there are separate regions
that process different frequencies of sound. All of these systems work to give us a comprehensive
understanding of all our sensory experiences. Upon his creation, the creature is accosted with
sensory overload. He initially struggles to distinguish between all of these new sensations, but his
brain eventually learns how to process everything in tandem to give him a coherent view of the
surrounding world.

and sat down upon the ground. No distinct ideas occupied my mind; all was
confused. I felt light, and hunger, and thirst, and darkness; innumerable
sounds rung in my ears, and on all sides various scents saluted me: the
only object that I could distinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my
eyes on that with pleasure.
“Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had
greatly lessened when I began to distinguish my sensations from each other.
I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink, and
the trees that shaded me with their foliage. I was delighted when I first
discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my ears, proceeded
from the throats of the little winged animals who had often intercepted
the light from my eyes. I began also to observe, with greater accuracy, the
forms that surrounded me, and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant
roof of light which canopied me. Sometimes I tried to imitate the pleasant
songs of the birds, but was unable. Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which
broke from me frightened me into silence again.
“The moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened
form, shewed itself, while I still remained in the forest. My sensations had,
by this time, become distinct, and my mind received every day additional
ideas. My eyes became accustomed to the light, and to perceive objects in
their right forms; I distinguished the insect from the herb, and, by degrees,
one herb from another. I found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh
notes, whilst those of the blackbird and thrush were sweet and enticing.
“One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been left
by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the warmth
I experienced from it. In my joy I thrust my hand into the live embers,
but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain. How strange, I thought,
that the same cause should produce such opposite effects!15 I examined
the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be composed of wood.
I quickly collected some branches; but they were wet, and would not burn.
15. The emotions of shock and surprise reflect violations of expectations. When you experience a
shock or surprise, your physiology causes you to prepare to understand the situation in greater
detail. You draw in your breath, widen your eyes, and expand your focus of attention to see what
might have caused the violation of expectation. You also get a release of adrenaline in case the
surprise reflects a need to fight or flee. A very large violation of expectations, which leads to fullblown shock, can leave someone unable to move or speak for several seconds. This near paralysis
provides time to observe what could have caused the surprise and prevents someone from taking
an action that might be dangerous for her until she understands the situation more fully.

I was pained at this, and sat still watching the operation of the fire. The wet
wood which I had placed near the heat dried, and itself became inflamed.
I reflected on this; and, by touching the various branches, I discovered
the cause, and busied myself in collecting a great quantity of wood, that
I might dry it, and have a plentiful supply of fire. When night came on,
and brought sleep with it, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be
extinguished. I covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves, and placed
wet branches upon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground,
and sunk into sleep.
“It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire. I
uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame. I observed
this also, and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the embers when
they were nearly extinguished. When night came again, I found, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat; and that the discovery of this
element was useful to me in my food; for I found some of the offals that the
travellers had left had been roasted, and tasted much more savoury than
the berries I gathered from the trees. I tried, therefore, to dress my food
in the same manner, placing it on the live embers. I found that the berries
were spoiled by this operation, and the nuts and roots much improved.
“Food, however, became scarce; and I often spent the whole day searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. When I found
this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto inhabited, to seek for
one where the few wants I experienced would be more easily satisfied. In
this emigration, I exceedingly lamented the loss of the fire which I had
obtained through accident, and knew not how to re-produce it. I gave several hours to the serious consideration of this deficiency; but I was obliged
to relinquish all attempts to supply it; and, wrapping myself up in my cloak,
I struck across the wood towards the setting sun. I passed three days in
these rambles, and at length discovered the open country. A great fall of
snow had taken place the night before, and the fields were of one uniform
white; the appearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the
cold damp substance that covered the ground.
“It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and
shelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which had
doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd. This was a new
sight to me; and I examined the structure with great curiosity. Finding the
door open, I entered. An old man sat in it, near a fire, over which he was
preparing his breakfast. He turned on hearing a noise; and, perceiving me,
shrieked loudly, and, quitting the hut, ran across the fields with a speed
of which his debilitated form hardly appeared capable. His appearance, 
86 FRANKENSTEIN
different from any I had ever before seen, and his flight, somewhat surprised me. But I was enchanted by the appearance of the hut: here the
snow and rain could not penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented
to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as Pandæmonium appeared
to the dæmons of hell after their sufferings in the lake of fire. I greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd’s breakfast, which consisted
of bread, cheese, milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like. Then,
overcome by fatigue, I lay down among some straw, and fell asleep.
“It was noon when I awoke; and, allured by the warmth of the sun,
which shone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence
my travels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant’s breakfast in a
wallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, until at sunset I arrived at a village. How miraculous did this appear! the huts, the
neater cottages, and stately houses, engaged my admiration by turns. The
vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw placed at the
windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite. One of the best of
these I entered; but I had hardly placed my foot within the door, before the
children shrieked, and one of the women fainted. The whole village was
roused; some fled, some attacked me, until, grievously bruised by stones
and many other kinds of missile weapons, I escaped to the open country,
and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel, quite bare, and making a wretched
appearance after the palaces I had beheld in the village. This hovel, however, joined a cottage of a neat and pleasant appearance; but, after my
late dearly-bought experience, I dared not enter it. My place of refuge was
constructed of wood, but so low, that I could with difficulty sit upright in it.
No wood, however, was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it
was dry; and although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found
it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain.
“Here then I retreated, and lay down, happy to have found a shelter,
however miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more from
the barbarity of man.
“As soon as morning dawned, I crept from my kennel, that I might view
the adjacent cottage, and discover if I could remain in the habitation I had
found. It was situated against the back of the cottage, and surrounded on
the sides which were exposed by a pig-stye and a clear pool of water. One
part was open, and by that I had crept in; but now I covered every crevice
by which I might be perceived with stones and wood, yet in such a manner
that I might move them on occasion to pass out: all the light I enjoyed came
through the stye, and that was sufficient for me.
Volume II 87
“Having thus arranged my dwelling, and carpeted it with clean straw, I
retired; for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered too
well my treatment the night before, to trust myself in his power. I had first,
however, provided for my sustenance for that day, by a loaf of coarse bread,
which I purloined, and a cup with which I could drink, more conveniently
than from my hand, of the pure water which flowed by my retreat. The
floor was a little raised, so that it was kept perfectly dry, and by its vicinity
to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably warm.
“Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel, until something
should occur which might alter my determination. It was indeed a paradise, compared to the bleak forest, my former residence, the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth. I ate my breakfast with pleasure, and was
about to remove a plank to procure myself a little water, when I heard a
step, and, looking through a small chink, I beheld a young creature, with a
pail on her head, passing before my hovel. The girl was young and of gentle
demeanour, unlike what I have since found cottagers and farm-house servants to be. Yet she was meanly dressed, a coarse blue petticoat and a linen
jacket being her only garb; her fair hair was plaited, but not adorned; she
looked patient, yet sad. I lost sight of her; and in about a quarter of an hour
she returned, bearing the pail, which was now partly filled with milk. As
she walked along, seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met
her, whose countenance expressed a deeper despondence. Uttering a few
sounds with an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head, and bore
it to the cottage himself. She followed, and they disappeared. Presently
I saw the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field
behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the house,
and sometimes in the yard.
“On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the
cottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been filled
up with wood. In one of these was a small and almost imperceptible chink,
through which the eye could just penetrate. Through this crevice, a small
room was visible, white-washed and clean, but very bare of furniture. In
one corner, near a small fire, sat an old man, leaning his head on his hands
in a disconsolate attitude. The young girl was occupied in arranging the
cottage; but presently she took something out of a drawer, which employed
her hands, and she sat down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play, and to produce sounds, sweeter than the voice of the
thrush or the nightingale. It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch!
who had never beheld aught beautiful before. The silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager, won my reverence; while the gentle 
88 FRANKENSTEIN
manners of the girl enticed my love. He played a sweet mournful air, which
I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of which
the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then pronounced
a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt at his feet. He
raised her, and smiled with such kindness and affection, that I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature: they were a mixture of pain
and pleasure, such as I had never before experienced, either from hunger
or cold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from the window, unable to bear
these emotions.
“Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a
load of wood. The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of his burden, and, taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on the fire; then
she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage, and he shewed
her a large loaf and a piece of cheese. She seemed pleased; and went into
the garden for some roots and plants, which she placed in water, and then
upon the fire. She afterwards continued her work, whilst the young man
went into the garden, and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots. After he had been employed thus about an hour, the young
woman joined him, and they entered the cottage together.
“The old man had, in the mean time, been pensive; but, on the appearance of his companions, he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down
to eat. The meal was quickly dispatched. The young woman was again
occupied in arranging the cottage; the old man walked before the cottage
in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth. Nothing
could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures.
One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming with benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in his figure, and his
features were moulded with the finest symmetry; yet his eyes and attitude
expressed the utmost sadness and despondency. The old man returned to
the cottage; and the youth, with tools different from those he had used in
the morning, directed his steps across the fields.
“Night quickly shut in; but, to my extreme wonder, I found that the
cottagers had a means of prolonging light, by the use of tapers, and was
delighted to find, that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the
pleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours. In the evening,
the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations
which I did not understand; and the old man again took up the instrument,
which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning. So soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play, but to utter
sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the harmony of the 
Volume II 89
old man’s instrument or the songs of the birds; I since found that he read
aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of the science of words or letters.
“The family, after having been thus occupied for a short time, extinguished their lights, and retired, as I conjectured, to rest.
CHAPTER IV.
“I lay on my straw, but I could not sleep. I thought of the occurrences of the
day. What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people; and
I longed to join them, but dared not. I remembered too well the treatment
I had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers, and resolved,
whatever course of conduct I might hereafter think it right to pursue, that
for the present I would remain quietly in my hovel, watching, and endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their actions.
“The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun. The young woman
arranged the cottage, and prepared the food; and the youth departed after
the first meal.
“This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it.
The young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in various laborious occupations within. The old man, whom I soon perceived to
be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument, or in contemplation. Nothing could exceed the love and respect which the younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion. They performed
towards him every little office of affection and duty with gentleness; and
he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.
“They were not entirely happy. The young man and his companion
often went apart, and appeared to weep. I saw no cause for their unhappiness; but I was deeply affected by it. If such lovely creatures were miserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being, should be
wretched. Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy? They possessed a
delightful house (for such it was in my eyes), and every luxury; they had
a fire to warm them when chill, and delicious viands when hungry; they
were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more, they enjoyed one another’s company and speech, interchanging each day looks of affection and
kindness. What did their tears imply? Did they really express pain? I was
at first unable to solve these questions; but perpetual attention, and time,
explained to me many appearances which were at first enigmatic.
“A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of
the uneasiness of this amiable family; it was poverty: and they suffered
that evil in a very distressing degree. Their nourishment consisted entirely 
90 FRANKENSTEIN
of the vegetables of their garden, and the milk of one cow, which gave very
little during the winter, when its masters could scarcely procure food to
support it. They often, I believe, suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two younger cottagers; for several times they placed
food before the old man, when they reserved none for themselves.
“This trait of kindness moved me sensibly.16 I had been accustomed,
during the night, to steal a part of their store for my own consumption;
but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on the cottagers, I
abstained, and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and roots, which I gathered from a neighbouring wood.17
16. We can think of kindness from two different perspectives: terminating and ongoing. A terminating perspective focuses on an individual act of kindness as not being valuable in itself but
mainly valuable in the aim it will achieve. Conversely, an ongoing perspective privileges both the
individual act itself and the accumulation of acts over time, which might lead to some particular
aim. Both perspectives are rooted in a need to do for others, but the former rejects kindness as
a process. The creature seems to understand kindness as a process. Through his many encounters
with the family, he develops an ever-deepening recognition and awareness of them as individuals
doing for one another. This recognition is significant because spending the time to build awareness
of others is part of the mechanism of kindness: thus, when the creature spends this time, he has
already begun the process of kindness himself. He progresses from simply recognizing and becoming aware of others to not only refraining from stealing their food but caring for them by chopping
wood and leaving it for them at their doorstep. As we can see, he feels tremendous gratification
from his actions. Ongoing kindness involves all of the features the creature experiences: recognition,
awareness, and care. Scientific endeavors outside of Victor’s might be equally rewarded by using
ongoing kindness as an ethical approach to research. By recognizing the possible implications of
our scientific endeavors, being aware of not only the benefits but potential detriments, and acting
with care, we might experience the “true pleasure” in being in service for others.
Jameien Taylor.
17. Although compassion—empathy or sympathy with the plight of others—and other positive
sentiments and virtues may seem inherent personal characteristics, Frankenstein makes clear
that circumstances can inspire virtues, such as compassion, and changed circumstances can eradicate or obscure them. The creature’s observation of the cottagers’ poverty as well as of their compassionate behavior toward their elderly relative instructs him in compassion. He stops stealing
their food for himself, as he had previously done, and secretly provides them with firewood. But as
the novel progresses, the creature suffers increasingly from feelings of abandonment, which inspire
acts of revenge against Victor. He can remember that he was once compassionate, but he knows
he is no longer so. “I am malicious because I am miserable,” he explains. “[I]f I cannot inspire love,
I will cause fear” (p. 121). Victor likewise demonstrates compassion when he is happy with himself
and the world but intense selfishness and unconcern for others (especially Elizabeth) when he isn’t.
If virtue is even partly circumstantial, then all who act in the world, including scientists, must
recognize that judgments about their own worth and the value of their work require close scrutiny.
Victor acted alone, without consulting anyone about the value of his invention or its potential unintended consequences. If he had conferred with a community of thinkers and innovators with cooler
heads, perhaps he could have rekindled his own compassion and avoided the cascading tragedy
that emanates from his solitary creation.

“I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist
their labours. I found that the youth spent a great part of each day in collecting wood for the family fire; and, during the night, I often took his tools,
the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home firing sufficient
for the consumption of several days.
“I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she
opened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a
great pile of wood on the outside. She uttered some words in a loud voice,
and the youth joined her, who also expressed surprise. I observed, with
pleasure, that he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing
the cottage, and cultivating the garden.
“By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment. I found that
these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and
feelings to one another by articulate sounds. I perceived that the words
they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the
minds and countenances of the hearers. This was indeed a godlike science,
and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it. But I was baffled in
every attempt I made for this purpose. Their pronunciation was quick; and
the words they uttered, not having any apparent connexion with visible
objects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the
mystery of their reference. By great application, however, and after having
remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel,
I discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects
of discourse: I learned and applied the words fire, milk, bread, and wood.
I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves. The youth and his
companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only one,
which was father. The girl was called sister, or Agatha; and the youth Felix,
brother, or son. I cannot describe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas
appropriated to each of these sounds, and was able to pronounce them. I
distinguished several other words, without being able as yet to understand
or apply them; such as good, dearest, unhappy.
18
“I spent the winter in this manner. The gentle manners and beauty of
the cottagers greatly endeared them to me: when they were unhappy, I
felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathized in their joys. I saw few
human beings beside them; and if any other happened to enter the cottage,
18. The creature is a good if simple empiricist, understanding words for concrete objects but
having more difficulty with words that represent abstract concepts. Perhaps at this stage
in his development, he—much like Victor—can master objects but not feelings, causes but
not concepts.

92 FRANKENSTEIN
their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of my friends. The old man, I could perceive, often endeavoured
to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that he called them, to cast
off their melancholy. He would talk in a cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even upon me. Agatha listened with
respect, her eyes sometimes filled with tears, which she endeavoured to
wipe away unperceived; but I generally found that her countenance and tone
were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father. It
was not thus with Felix. He was always the saddest of the groupe; and, even
to my unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than
his friends. But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more
cheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old man.
“I could mention innumerable instances, which, although slight, marked
the dispositions of these amiable cottagers. In the midst of poverty and
want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white flower
that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground. Early in the morning
before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that obstructed her path
to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and brought the wood from
the outhouse, where, to his perpetual astonishment, he found his store
always replenished by an invisible hand. In the day, I believe, he worked
sometimes for a neighbouring farmer, because he often went forth, and did
not return until dinner, yet brought no wood with him. At other times he
worked in the garden; but, as there was little to do in the frosty season, he
read to the old man and Agatha.
“This reading had puzzled me extremely at first; but, by degrees, I discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he
talked. I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs for speech
which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend these also; but
how was that possible, when I did not even understand the sounds for
which they stood as signs? I improved, however, sensibly in this science, but
not sufficiently to follow up any kind of conversation, although I applied
my whole mind to the endeavour: for I easily perceived that, although I
eagerly longed to discover myself to the cottagers, I ought not to make the
attempt until I had first become master of their language; which knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure;
for with this also the contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made
me acquainted.19
19. The creature here perceives the human tendency to distinguish between members of the
in-group and members of the out-group and to fear and despise the latter: “othering,” as it
is sometimes known. He also suggests, plausibly, that othering occurs where the target is not 
Volume II 93
“I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers—their grace, beauty,
and delicate complexions: but how was I terrified, when I viewed myself
in a transparent pool!20 At first I started back, unable to believe that it
was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became fully
convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was filled with the
bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification. Alas! I did not yet
entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity.
“As the sun became warmer, and the light of day longer, the snow vanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth. From this time
Felix was more employed; and the heart-moving indications of impending
famine disappeared. Their food, as I afterwards found, was coarse, but it
was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it. Several new kinds
of plants sprung up in the garden, which they dressed; and these signs of
comfort increased daily as the season advanced.
“The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did
not rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its waters.
This frequently took place; but a high wind quickly dried the earth, and
the season became far more pleasant than it had been.
simply different from the audience but also not understood, and he hopes to overcome this gap
in understanding through communication with the cottagers. As his monologue continues,
parallels are drawn between his situation and that of various outsiders and outcasts in history
who have also been othered: immigrants (Safie and her father), the poor, the lowborn, and
the orphaned. Mary Shelley herself is not immune from this tendency: see, for instance, her rather
broad generalizations about women in Islam and her apparent approval of European colonization.
We must recognize that other people, especially those different from us, are not just sources
of exclusion and anguish. The creature’s monologue is also a story of human development—
from securing the most basic means of survival to engaging with language and literature—
and it emphasizes, too, the essential role of communing with others unlike us in achieving selfconsciousness and fulfillment. Thus, it reveals the creature’s deep desire to interact with humans,
a different species, and then with a created romantic partner of a different sex.
For another view on how being perceived by others is both essential to achieving selfconsciousness and a potential source of deep despair, given our dependency on them for our
sense of worth, one might compare Sartre’s theory in Being and Nothingness ([1943] 2012).

20. The creature experiences fear and terror because his reflection reveals that he looks much
different from others whom he has encountered. In this way, his self-knowledge is informed
by others—that is, he sees, knows, and understands himself as society sees, knows, and understands him. This scene suggests that individual or personal identity is developed in part via
cultural constructions of what it is beautiful, normal, acceptable, moral, and so forth. We come
to know ourselves—and even to fear ourselves—through our encounters with others, and what
society deems as “normal” often influences our self-perceptions.

“My mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During the morning I
attended the motions of the cottagers; and when they were dispersed in
various occupations, I slept: the remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends. When they had retired to rest, if there was any moon, or
the night was star-light, I went into the woods, and collected my own food
and fuel for the cottage. When I returned, as often as it was necessary, I
cleared their path from the snow, and performed those offices that I had
seen done by Felix. I afterwards found that these labours, performed by an
invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and once or twice I heard them,
on these occasions, utter the words good spirit, wonderful; but I did not
then understand the signification of these terms.
“My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the
motives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to know
why Felix appeared so miserable, and Agatha so sad. I thought (foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these
deserving people. When I slept, or was absent, the forms of the venerable
blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix, flitted before me.
I looked upon them as superior beings, who would be the arbiters of my
future destiny. I formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of me. I imagined that they
would be disgusted, until, by my gentle demeanour and conciliating words,
I should first win their favour, and afterwards their love.
“These thoughts exhilarated me, and led me to apply with fresh ardour
to the acquiring the art of language. My organs were indeed harsh, but
supple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones,
yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease. It was as
the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass, whose intentions were
affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved better treatment
than blows and execration.21
21. Here the creature refers to one of the fables by Aesop (620–560 BCE). A farmer’s donkey
becomes jealous of the famer’s affection for his pet lap dog. The hard-working donkey tries to get
the farmer’s attention by imitating the lap dog’s playful behavior. When the donkey jumps up on
the farmer, expecting to be petted, bystanders become fearful and attack the donkey for acting
uncharacteristically. One popular interpretation of the moral of the story is not to try to be someone
you are not. Mary turns the meaning of the fable on its head by focusing on the injustice that happens when a creature’s efforts to obtain affection are rebuffed and punished. There are many
instances throughout the novel where the creature witnesses others expressing love and kindness
toward one another, and so he desires to be treated the same. When his bid to be admitted into
humanity is rejected, he lashes out. Mary suggests outrage is one possible reaction to rejection
and exclusion.

“The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the
aspect of the earth. Men, who before this change seemed to have been hid
in caves, dispersed themselves, and were employed in various arts of cultivation. The birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves began to bud
forth on the trees. Happy, happy earth! fit habitation for gods, which, so
short a time before, was bleak, damp, and unwholesome. My spirits were
elevated by the enchanting appearance of nature; the past was blotted
from my memory, the present was tranquil, and the future gilded by bright
rays of hope, and anticipations of joy.
CHAPTER V.
“I now hasten to the more moving part of my story. I shall relate events that
impressed me with feelings which, from what I was, have made me what
I am.
“Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine, and the skies
cloudless. It surprised me, that what before was desert and gloomy should
now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure. My senses were
gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight, and a thousand
sights of beauty.
“It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested
from labour—the old man played on his guitar, and the children listened
to him—I observed that the countenance of Felix was melancholy beyond
expression: he sighed frequently; and once his father paused in his music,
and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired the cause of his son’s sorrow. Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and the old man was recommencing
his music, when some one tapped at the door.
“It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a countryman as a guide.
The lady was dressed in a dark suit, and covered with a thick black veil.
Agatha asked a question; to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing,
in a sweet accent, the name of Felix. Her voice was musical, but unlike
that of either of my friends. On hearing this word, Felix came up hastily to
the lady; who, when she saw him, threw up her veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression. Her hair of a shining raven black,
and curiously braided; her eyes were dark, but gentle, although animated;
her features of a regular proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair,
each cheek tinged with a lovely pink.
“Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of sorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic
joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his eyes sparkled, as 
96 FRANKENSTEIN
his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I thought him as
beautiful as the stranger. She appeared affected by different feelings; wiping
a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held out her hand to Felix, who kissed
it rapturously, and called her, as well as I could distinguish, his sweet
Arabian. She did not appear to understand him, but smiled. He assisted
her to dismount, and, dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage.
Some conversation took place between him and his father; and the young
stranger knelt at the old man’s feet, and would have kissed his hand, but
he raised her, and embraced her affectionately.
“I soon perceived, that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds,
and appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood
by, or herself understood, the cottagers. They made many signs which I did
not comprehend; but I saw that her presence diffused gladness through the
cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists.
Felix seemed peculiarly happy, and with smiles of delight welcomed his
Arabian. Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed the hands of the lovely
stranger; and, pointing to her brother, made signs which appeared to me
to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came. Some hours passed
thus, while they, by their countenances, expressed joy, the cause of which
I did not comprehend. Presently I found, by the frequent recurrence of one
sound which the stranger repeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language; and the idea instantly occurred to me, that I
should make use of the same instructions to the same end. The stranger
learned about twenty words at the first lesson, most of them indeed were
those which I had before understood, but I profited by the others.
“As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early. When they
separated, Felix kissed the hand of the stranger, and said, ‘Good night,
sweet Safie.’ He sat up much longer, conversing with his father; and, by
the frequent repetition of her name, I conjectured that their lovely guest
was the subject of their conversation. I ardently desired to understand
them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found it utterly
impossible.
“The next morning Felix went out to his work; and, after the usual occupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the old man,
and, taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly beautiful, that
they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes. She sang, and
her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or dying away, like a nightingale
of the woods.
“When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first
declined it. She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in sweet 
Volume II 97
accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. The old man
appeared enraptured, and said some words, which Agatha endeavoured
to explain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she
bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.
“The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration,
that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends. Safie
was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the knowledge of
language, so that in two months I began to comprehend most of the words
uttered by my protectors.
“In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and
the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the scent
and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods; the sun
became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal rambles
were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun; for I never ventured
abroad during day-light, fearful of meeting with the same treatment as I
had formerly endured in the first village which I entered.
“My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily master
the language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than the Arabian, who understood very little, and conversed in broken accents, whilst I
comprehended and could imitate almost every word that was spoken.
“While I improved in speech, I also learned the science of letters, as
it was taught to the stranger; and this opened before me a wide field for
wonder and delight.
“The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney’s Ruins of
Empires. I should not have understood the purport of this book, had not
Felix, in reading it, given very minute explanations. He had chosen this
work, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of
the eastern authors. Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of
history, and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world;
it gave me an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the
different nations of the earth. I heard of the slothful Asiatics; of the stupendous genius and mental activity of the Grecians; of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early Romans—of their subsequent degeneration—of the
decline of that mighty empire; of chivalry, Christianity, and kings. I heard
of the discovery of the American hemisphere, and wept with Safie over the
hapless fate of its original inhabitants.
“These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. Was man,
indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous, and magnificent, yet so vicious
and base? He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle, and 
98 FRANKENSTEIN
at another as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike. To be a great
and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive
being; to be base and vicious, as many on record have been, appeared the
lowest degradation, a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or
harmless worm. For a long time I could not conceive how one man could go
forth to murder his fellow, or even why there were laws and governments;
but when I heard details of vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased, and I
turned away with disgust and loathing.
“Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me.
While I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the Arabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me. I heard of
the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty; of rank,
descent, and noble blood.22
“The words induced me to turn towards myself. I learned that the possessions most esteemed by your fellow-creatures were, high and unsullied descent united with riches. A man might be respected with only one
of these acquisitions; but without either he was considered, except in
very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profit of the chosen few. And what was I? Of my creation and
creator I was absolutely ignorant; but I knew that I possessed no money,
no friends, no kind of property. I was, besides, endowed with a figure
hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even of the same nature as
man. I was more agile than they, and could subsist upon coarser diet; I
bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded their’s.23 When I looked around, I saw and heard of none
22. Much of the novel is inspired by the writings of philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–
1778), who believed that humans in their natural state are good and that society corrupts them.
Like Rousseau’s character Emile (Rousseau [1762] 1979), the creature learns from his environment and only slowly is introduced to society. Whether governments and laws can maintain order
or are part of the social ill remains an unanswered question. The two trial scenes in the novel,
Justine’s and later Victor’s, serve as examples of the problems of mobs and the difficulties of
attaining justice. It was common during this period to see humans as a link in the “great chain
of being”: we can climb as high as angels or slip lower than animals on this chain through our
moral choices.
Ron Broglio.
23. Scientists have long aspired to improve the human body, or create new bodies, to exceed our
natural biological limits. The United States military pursues a range of research areas to enhance
the performance of soldiers, from powered exoskeletons granting their users superhuman strength
to direct brain interfaces that would allow pilots to fly aircraft by thought alone. More broadly,
almost all biomedical technologies can be seen as serving the same purpose, from contact lenses
and pacemakers that regulate and improve the function of our organs to antibiotics that make us
far more resistant to disease. Many people feel that our bodies’ greatest flaw is aging and death.

like me.24 Was I then a monster, a blot upon the earth, from which all men
fled, and whom all men disowned?25
“I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon
me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with knowledge. Oh,
that I had for ever remained in my native wood, nor known or felt beyond
the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!
“Of what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to the mind, when it
has once seized on it, like a lichen on the rock. I wished sometimes to shake
off all thought and feeling; but I learned that there was but one means to
overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death—a state which I feared
yet did not understand. I admired virtue and good feelings, and loved the
gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers; but I was shut out
from intercourse with them, except through means which I obtained by
stealth, when I was unseen and unknown, and which rather increased
Philanthropists like Bill and Melinda Gates and Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan have invested
billions of dollars to eliminate disease and extend human life. Ongoing scientific debates about
life extension sometimes echo the quest for the philosopher’s stone as researchers contemplate
how the human body might be sustained or rejuvenated through genetic modification, personalized
drug cocktails, or other means.
Humanity’s technological obsession with overcoming our biological limits has a natural parallel
in science fiction. Mary’s vision of a superhuman creature inspired many others, from comic book
superheroes to the robots and replicants populating movies like The Terminator (James Cameron,
1984), Blade Runner (Ridley Scott, 1982), and Ex Machina (Alex Garland, 2015). These stories
ask many of the same questions posed in Frankenstein: what would a perfected human form really
be like? What kind of life would such a creature lead? What consequences would result from a
world in which humans and superhumans coexist?
Ed Finn.
24. The creature recounts how his life differs from normal human life. In future narratives, writers
directly confront what Mary here only touches upon lightly with allusions to slavery, ownership,
and property: that the creature might be “owned” by his creator or that he might be the subject of a
patent or that Victor might seek to monetize his investment of time and effort or that his secrecy
and obsession are in part motivated by greed as well as a desire for fame and glory.
Robert Cook-Deegan.
25. These musings from Victor’s creation invite us to consider what or who determines our selfidentity. Do we determine our own ideas of identity? Or do others—family, friends, general society,
or a creator—determine them? The creature’s social interactions leave him without sympathy
from the members of any of these categories, and thus he struggles to understand who or what he
is and what his role in life is. Developmental psychologist Erik Eriksen (1902–1994) theorized that
identity or our consciousness of self forms in eight stages by evolving through our social interactions. The creature’s questions model Eriksen’s adolescent stage of asking questions such as “Who
am I?” and “What can I be?” by comparing self to others. It is especially poignant that Mary leaves
the creature without a name for the duration of the book. His namelessness further highlights the
fact that he has no clear identity and no good way to define one.

than satisfied the desire I had of becoming one among my fellows. The
gentle words of Agatha, and the animated smiles of the charming Arabian,
were not for me. The mild exhortations of the old man, and the lively conversation of the loved Felix, were not for me. Miserable, unhappy wretch!
“Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply. I heard of
the difference of sexes; of the birth and growth of children; how the father
doated on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the older child;
how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapt up in the precious
charge; how the mind of youth expanded and gained knowledge; of brother,
sister, and all the various relationships which bind one human being to
another in mutual bonds.26
“But where were my friends and relations? No father had watched my
infant days, no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if they
had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I distinguished nothing. From my earliest remembrance I had been as I then was
in height and proportion. I had never yet seen a being resembling me, or
who claimed any intercourse with me. What was I? The question again
recurred, to be answered only with groans.
“I will soon explain to what these feelings tended; but allow me now to
return to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various feelings of
indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated in additional
love and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in an innocent, half
painful self-deceit, to call them).
CHAPTER VI.
“Some time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends. It was one
which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding as it
did a number of circumstances each interesting and wonderful to one so
utterly inexperienced as I was.
26. Mary cautions against Victor’s myopic perspective that creation—bringing into existence—
is all that matters. The creature is made but un-parented, forced into solitary life, and exiled from
mainstream society. In his treatment of the creature, Victor shows no concern for social development, the human need for acceptance, and the importance of memory and shared experiences
to the creature’s initial and eventual selfhood and well-being. Although Victor later recognizes his
younger self in Henry Clerval’s desire for knowledge, a sign of Victor’s own concrete identity,
he fails to use any understanding of this self-recognition in his creation. This episode helps us
reflect on the idea that scientific discovery and creation are fully value laden, and bound up
in the assumptions and guiding philosophies of the scientists who discover and create.

Volume II 101
“The name of the old man was De Lacey. He was descended from a
good family in France, where he had lived for many years in affluence,
respected by his superiors, and beloved by his equals. His son was bred in
the service of his country; and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest distinction. A few months before my arrival, they had lived in a large
and luxurious city, called Paris, surrounded by friends, and possessed of
every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intellect, or taste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford.
“The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin. He was a Turkish
merchant, and had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some reason
which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government. He was
seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from Constantinople to join him. He was tried, and condemned to death. The injustice of
his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant; and it was judged
that his religion and wealth, rather than the crime alleged against him,
had been the cause of his condemnation.
“Felix had been present at the trial; his horror and indignation were
uncontrollable, when he heard the decision of the court. He made, at that
moment, a solemn vow to deliver him, and then looked around for the
means. After many fruitless attempts to gain admittance to the prison,
he found a strongly grated window in an unguarded part of the building,
which lighted the dungeon of the unfortunate Mahometan; who, loaded
with chains, waited in despair the execution of the barbarous sentence.
Felix visited the grate at night, and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour. The Turk, amazed and delighted, endeavoured to
kindle the zeal of his deliverer by promises of reward and wealth. Felix
rejected his offers with contempt; yet when he saw the lovely Safie, who
was allowed to visit her father, and who, by her gestures, expressed her
lively gratitude, the youth could not help owning to his own mind, that the
captive possessed a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard.
“The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made
on the heart of Felix, and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in his
interests by the promise of her hand in marriage, so soon as he should be
conveyed to a place of safety. Felix was too delicate to accept this offer; yet
he looked forward to the probability of that event as to the consummation
of his happiness.
“During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward
for the escape of the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several letters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to express her
thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old man, a servant of 
102 FRANKENSTEIN
her father’s, who understood French. She thanked him in the most ardent
terms for his intended services towards her father; and at the same time
she gently deplored her own fate.
“I have copies of these letters; for I found means, during my residence in
the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters were often
in the hands of Felix or Agatha. Before I depart, I will give them to you,
they will prove the truth of my tale; but at present, as the sun is already
far declined, I shall only have time to repeat the substance of them to you.
“Safie related, that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made
a slave by the Turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart
of the father of Safie, who married her.27 The young girl spoke in high
and enthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in freedom spurned the
bondage to which she was now reduced. She instructed her daughter in
the tenets of her religion, and taught her to aspire to higher powers of
intellect, and an independence of spirit, forbidden to the female followers
of Mahomet. This lady died; but her lessons were indelibly impressed on
the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again returning to Asia,
and the being immured within the walls of a haram, allowed only to occupy
herself with puerile amusements, ill suited to the temper of her soul, now
accustomed to grand ideas and a noble emulation for virtue. The prospect
of marrying a Christian, and remaining in a country where women were
allowed to take a rank in society, was enchanting to her.
“The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed; but, on the night previous to it, he had quitted prison, and before morning was distant many
leagues from Paris. Felix had procured passports in the name of his father,
sister, and himself. He had previously communicated his plan to the former,
who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under the pretence of a journey,
and concealed himself, with his daughter, in an obscure part of Paris.
27. Mary wrote Frankenstein at a time when slavery was still prevalent in Europe and the Americas.
Revolutionary France had abolished slavery, but Napoleon reintroduced it after he came to power.
In England, the law ending the British slave trade in 1807 culminated a remarkable two decades
of abolitionist activism, although slavery itself would persist until the Slavery Abolition Act ended
the practice in 1834. William Godwin himself had written about slavery in his most famous work,
An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice, asking rhetorically, “Have we slaves? We assiduously
retain them in ignorance” ([1793] 2013, 461). The Congress of Vienna, through which European
nations attempted to settle the consequences of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic
Wars, declared its opposition to slavery in 1815. In the United States, many northern states were
beginning a slow process of abolition and freeing currently held slaves around the time Mary
was writing Frankenstein, but the nation as a whole would not abolish slavery until after the Civil
War (1861–1865) with the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.

“Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons, and across Mont
Cenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable
opportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions.
“Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his departure, before which time the Turk renewed his promise that she should be
united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in expectation of
that event; and in the mean time he enjoyed the society of the Arabian,
who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest affection. They conversed with one another through the means of an interpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and Safie sang to him the divine airs
of her native country.
“The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place, and encouraged the
hopes of the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other
plans. He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a Christian; but he feared the resentment of Felix if he should appear lukewarm;
for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer, if he should
choose to betray him to the Italian state which they inhabited. He revolved
a thousand plans by which he should be enabled to prolong the deceit until
it might be no longer necessary, and secretly to take his daughter with him
when he departed. His plans were greatly facilitated by the news which
arrived from Paris.
“The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their
victim, and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer. The plot
of Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were thrown
into prison. The news reached Felix, and roused him from his dream of
pleasure. His blind and aged father, and his gentle sister, lay in a noisome
dungeon, while he enjoyed the free air, and the society of her whom he
loved. This idea was torture to him. He quickly arranged with the Turk,
that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity for escape before
Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a boarder at a convent at
Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian, he hastened to Paris, and
delivered himself up to the vengeance of the law, hoping to free De Lacey
and Agatha by this proceeding.
“He did not succeed. They remained confined for five months before the
trial took place; the result of which deprived them of their fortune, and
condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country.
“They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I
discovered them. Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for whom
he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on discovering that
his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and impotence, became a traitor 
104 FRANKENSTEIN
to good feeling and honour, and had quitted Italy with his daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him, as he said, in some plan
of future maintenance.
“Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix, and rendered
him, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his family. He could have
endured poverty, and when this distress had been the meed of his virtue,
he would have gloried in it: but the ingratitude of the Turk, and the loss
of his beloved Safie, were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable. The
arrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul.
“When the news reached Leghorn, that Felix was deprived of his wealth
and rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her
lover, but to prepare to return with him to her native country. The generous nature of Safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to
expostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his tyrannical mandate.
“A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter’s apartment, and told
her hastily, that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn had
been divulged, and that he should speedily be delivered up to the French
government; he had, consequently, hired a vessel to convey him to Constantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours. He intended to
leave his daughter under the care of a confidential servant, to follow at her
leisure with the greater part of his property, which had not yet arrived at
Leghorn.
“When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that
it would become her to pursue in this emergency. A residence in Turkey
was abhorrent to her; her religion and feelings were alike adverse to it.
By some papers of her father’s, which fell into her hands, she heard of the
exile of her lover, and learnt the name of the spot where he then resided.
She hesitated some time, but at length she formed her determination. Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her, and a small sum of money,
she quitted Italy, with an attendant, a native of Leghorn, but who understood the common language of Turkey, and departed for Germany.
“She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage
of De Lacey, when her attendant fell dangerously ill. Safie nursed her with
the most devoted affection; but the poor girl died, and the Arabian was left
alone, unacquainted with the language of the country, and utterly ignorant
of the customs of the world. She fell, however, into good hands. The Italian
had mentioned the name of the spot for which they were bound; and, after
her death, the woman of the house in which they had lived took care that
Safie should arrive in safety at the cottage of her lover.
Volume II 105
CHAPTER VII.
“Such was the history of my beloved cottagers. It impressed me deeply. I
learned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admire their
virtues, and to deprecate the vices of mankind.28
“As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil; benevolence and generosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to become an
actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities were called
forth and displayed. But, in giving an account of the progress of my intellect, I must not omit a circumstance which occurred in the beginning of the
month of August of the same year.
“One night, during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood,
where I collected my own food, and brought home firing for my protectors,
I found on the ground a leathern portmanteau, containing several articles
of dress and some books. I eagerly seized the prize, and returned with it to
my hovel. Fortunately the books were written in the language the elements
of which I had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of Paradise Lost, a
volume of Plutarch’s Lives, and the Sorrows of Werter.
29 The possession of
these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now continually studied and
exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were employed
in their ordinary occupations.
“I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books. They produced
in me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me
to ecstacy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. In the
Sorrows of Werter, besides the interest of its simple and affecting story,
28. A significant part of who we are as individuals is created in response to what we observe in
others. The creature, abandoned by his creator, has the good fortune to find a loving and admirable
family to watch and attempt to mimic. It is unclear how many of the De Laceys’ admirable qualities
are genuine and how many are a product of the creature’s desire to find in others the qualities
he wishes he had found in his creator. What is clear, however, is that the act of creation is only one
small component of the creature’s tale, and the same is true for any scientific or technological
endeavor. The wider social context in which the act of creation takes place will have an impact on
the final place and shape of the knowledge or technologies created by the scientist or engineer.

29. These three texts were on Mary’s reading list the summer before she began writing Frankenstein. They represent a kind of literary education for the creature. From Plutarch, he would learn
about the great leaders of the Greco-Roman world and the nature of politics and public affairs.
In Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s Sorrows of Young Werther (1774), he would read about domestic
life and social relationships, particularly as they apply to the difficult business of adolescence
and growing up. Finally, from John Milton’s Paradise Lost (1667) the creature would learn about
faith and the complexities of good and evil. In Milton’s story, Satan, the fallen angel, is a charismatic
antihero who challenges his creator.

so many opinions are canvassed, and so many lights thrown upon what
had hitherto been to me obscure subjects, that I found in it a never-ending
source of speculation and astonishment. The gentle and domestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and feelings, which had
for their object something out of self, accorded well with my experience
among my protectors, and with the wants which were for ever alive in my
own bosom. But I thought Werter himself a more divine being than I had
ever beheld or imagined; his character contained no pretension, but it sunk
deep. The disquisitions upon death and suicide were calculated to fill me
with wonder. I did not pretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I
inclined towards the opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without
precisely understanding it.
“As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and
condition. I found myself similar, yet at the same time strangely unlike the
beings concerning whom I read, and to whose conversation I was a listener.
I sympathized with, and partly understood them, but I was unformed
in mind; I was dependent on none, and related to none. ‘The path of my
departure was free’; and there was none to lament my annihilation. My
person was hideous, and my stature gigantic: what did this mean? Who
was I? What was I? Whence did I come? What was my destination? These
questions continually recurred, but I was unable to solve them.30
30. Who are we really? What are we made of? What is the self? What makes the creation a
monster? Of course, answers to the latter question depend on how we define the term monster.
Victor makes his creation by sewing together the body parts of many individuals, leaving the
creation unaware of his own identity. The creature’s composite nature, his lack of a singular
physical and mental identity, is an important aspect of his monstrosity.
Our current scientific understanding of what we are made of can help us in understanding this
idea of monstrosity. Humans and most other forms of life have a genetic conflict within them.
This conflict arises from being composed of genetically distinct entities. For example, in “microchimerism,” there are genetically distinct cells in a human body that come from a mother or an elder
sibling (from the child’s perspective) or from a child (from the mother’s perspective). There are
also genetically distinct gut microbiota, which can influence behavior, as can viral infections such
as rabies. In these cases, our physiology and behavior can be influenced by genetically distinct
entities that have fitness interests different from our own.
Taking Mary’s idea of a monster and joining it with current knowledge about our genetically
heterogeneous nature, we arrive at a potentially useful conception of a monster as an individual
whose physiology and behavior are (fully or partially) under the control of a genetically distinct
individual or population of individuals. Understanding ourselves as biologically heterogeneous,
we can more easily and perhaps more sympathetically explore the idea of the monster’s composite
nature and Victor’s struggle with his creation. Unlike Victor, we must face the fact that we are
all monsters.

Volume II 107
“The volume of Plutarch’s Lives which I possessed, contained the histories of the first founders of the ancient republics. This book had a far
different effect upon me from the Sorrows of Werter. I learned from Werter’s imaginations despondency and gloom: but Plutarch taught me high
thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own reflections,
to admire and love the heroes of past ages. Many things I read surpassed
my understanding and experience. I had a very confused knowledge of
kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers, and boundless seas. But
I was perfectly unacquainted with towns, and large assemblages of men.
The cottage of my protectors had been the only school in which I had studied human nature; but this book developed new and mightier scenes of
action. I read of men concerned in public affairs governing or massacring
their species. I felt the greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as far as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they were, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced
by these feelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable law-givers, Numa,
Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus. The patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a firm hold
on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had been made
by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should have been
imbued with different sensations.
“But Paradise Lost excited different and far deeper emotions. I read
it, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as a
true history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe, that the picture
of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of exciting.
I often referred the several situations, as their similarity struck me, to
my own. Like Adam, I was created apparently united by no link to any
other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine in every
other respect. He had come forth from the hands of God a perfect creature,
happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of his Creator; he was
allowed to converse with, and acquire knowledge from beings of a superior
nature: but I was wretched, helpless, and alone. Many times I considered
Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition; for often, like him, when I
viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter gall of envy rose within me.
“Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings.
Soon after my arrival in the hovel, I discovered some papers in the pocket
of the dress which I had taken from your laboratory. At first I had neglected
them; but now that I was able to decypher the characters in which they
were written, I began to study them with diligence. It was your journal
of the four months that preceded my creation. You minutely described in 
108 FRANKENSTEIN
these papers every step you took in the progress of your work; this history
was mingled with accounts of domestic occurrences. You, doubtless, recollect these papers. Here they are. Every thing is related in them which
bears reference to my accursed origin; the whole detail of that series of
disgusting circumstances which produced it is set in view; the minutest
description of my odious and loathsome person is given, in language which
painted your own horrors, and rendered mine ineffaceable. I sickened as
I read. ‘Hateful day when I received life!’ I exclaimed in agony. ‘Cursed
creator! Why did you form a monster so hideous that even you turned from
me in disgust? God in pity made man beautiful and alluring, after his own
image; but my form is a filthy type of your’s, more horrid from its very
resemblance.31 Satan had his companions, fellow-devils, to admire and
encourage him; but I am solitary and detested.’
“These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude;
but when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable and
benevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should become
acquainted with my admiration of their virtues, they would compassionate
me, and overlook my personal deformity. Could they turn from their door
one, however monstrous, who solicited their compassion and friendship?
I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way to fit myself for an
interview with them which would decide my fate. I postponed this attempt
for some months longer; for the importance attached to its success inspired
me with a dread lest I should fail. Besides, I found that my understanding improved so much with every day’s experience, that I was unwilling to
commence this undertaking until a few more months should have added
to my wisdom.
“Several changes, in the mean time, took place in the cottage. The presence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants; and I also found
that a greater degree of plenty reigned there. Felix and Agatha spent more
time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in their labours
31. Here Victor anticipates a problem confronting researchers in the fields of robotics and visual
animation as well as related fields. Anyone trying to create lifelike representations of natural
organisms will encounter what Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori ([1970] 2012) calls the “uncanny
valley.” Humans can feel a strong empathetic connection to creatures that do not closely resemble
us or other familiar living things. In film, for example, characters such as the robot Wall-E or the
extraterrestrial E.T. gain our sympathy even though they look unfamiliar. But as representations get
closer to the human form, they can enter the “uncanny valley,” where slight aberrations from our
expectations can generate feelings of aversion or disgust.
Mary suggests here that the creature’s ugliness derives not from his difference so much as from
his uncanny similarity to humans. See also Alfred Nordmann’s essay “Undisturbed by Reality” in this
volume, which discusses the origins of the notion of the uncanny.

by servants. They did not appear rich, but they were contented and happy;
their feelings were serene and peaceful, while mine became every day more
tumultuous. Increase of knowledge only discovered to me more clearly
what a wretched outcast I was. I cherished hope, it is true; but it vanished,
when I beheld my person reflected in water, or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail image and that inconstant shade.
“I endeavoured to crush these fears, and to fortify myself for the trial
which in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my
thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and
dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathizing with my feelings
and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathed smiles of consolation. But it was all a dream: no Eve soothed my sorrows, or shared my
thoughts; I was alone. I remembered Adam’s supplication to his Creator;
but where was mine? he had abandoned me, and, in the bitterness of my
heart, I cursed him.
“Autumn passed thus. I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay
and fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it had
worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon. Yet I did not heed
the bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by my conformation for
the endurance of cold than heat. But my chief delights were the sight of the
flowers, the birds, and all the gay apparel of summer; when those deserted
me, I turned with more attention towards the cottagers. Their happiness
was not decreased by the absence of summer. They loved, and sympathized
with one another; and their joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the casualties that took place around them. The more I saw of
them, the greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness;
my heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures: to see
their sweet looks turned towards me with affection, was the utmost limit
of my ambition.32 I dared not think that they would turn them from me
with disdain and horror. The poor that stopped at their door were never
32. Communion represents connection, a sharing or holding of things in common that is central
to achieving our full humanity. Social scientists today refer to communion in terms of intimacy
or perhaps love or even social support. Research has recently discovered what Mary intuited two
centuries ago—positive relationships are what keep us healthy and happy. We experience the irony
of watching Victor pursue his goal of creating life while isolating himself from what he later learns
is most life-giving—communion with family, friends, and lovers. And though he gives biological
life to his creation, he fails to give him what is most meaningful—communion. Many of us seem
driven to try alternative means of happiness (creation of our own monsters, perhaps) before we
realize that relationships are not superfluous but are instead essential in our lives. Victor’s disdain
for and rejection of his own creation (his dehumanization of the creation) become not only his own
undoing but also the causal agent for the transfiguration of his creation’s natural state of benevolence
to one of violence (the creation’s ill-guided attempts at discharging existential loneliness and pain).

driven away. I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a little food or
rest; I required kindness and sympathy; but I did not believe myself utterly
unworthy of it.33
“The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had
taken place since I awoke into life. My attention, at this time, was solely
directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my protectors. I revolved many projects; but that on which I finally fixed was, to
enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone. I had sagacity
enough to discover, that the unnatural hideousness of my person was the
chief object of horror with those who had formerly beheld me. My voice,
although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I thought, therefore, that if, in
the absence of his children, I could gain the good-will and mediation of the
old De Lacey, I might, by his means, be tolerated by my younger protectors.
Had Victor considered communion an essential part of “life,” he would have changed the plight of
his creation (who notes that communion, with even one person, would change his course) and
his own plight. Mary artfully presents the human experience as a process of seeking communion
and discharging the pain of disconnection. One is left to wonder if every person must endure
loss before understanding the value of communion and whether today’s inventors and innovators
keep communion more central in their imaginations than Victor does.

33. Victor’s creature has learned about humanity by observing humans and by reading poetry,
classical philosophy, and a highly sentimental novel. He believes himself to be worthy of or at least
not disqualified from receiving the kindly treatment that he has seen humans accord one another.
He has evaluated himself and found himself human.
Self-esteem, the assessment of value that people give themselves and their own behavior,
is a relatively recent psychological concept, dating from the late nineteenth century, and this
passage can be interpreted as an example of the increased focus on the individual that is associated
with the advent of romanticism. However, the process of evaluating one’s behavior and ranking
it relative to that of other people has been a human concern since the dawn of history. Self-esteem
presupposes awareness of self; it may be related to survival-enhancing, neurologically based
behaviors common to the many nonhuman social animals in whom self-awareness has been
identified. Research has recently been directed at identifying self-esteem-like behavior in primates
and other animals.
Victor’s creature seems to have, in addition to the desire to evaluate his own behavior, the ability
to judge the fairness of that behavior and the behavior of others: that is, he has a sense of justice.
There is evidence that an understanding of fairness or equity is a trait shared by many animals,
but research remains to be done to understand the mechanism by which various kinds of animals
assess whether another’s behavior is equitable or not. Even human concepts of justice can be
vague and contradictory and may differ from one culture to another, just as individual humans’
evaluation of their own behavior is not necessarily accurate and their opinion of themselves is
not necessarily shared by others (see Blanchard and Blanchard 2003; Blanchard, Blanchard, and
McKittrick 2001; Brosnan 2012; Christen and Glock 2012; and Heatherton and Vohs 2000).

Volume II 111
“One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground,
and diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha, and
Felix, departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own desire,
was left alone in the cottage. When his children had departed, he took up
his guitar, and played several mournful, but sweet airs, more sweet and
mournful than I had ever heard him play before. At first his countenance
was illuminated with pleasure, but, as he continued, thoughtfulness and
sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the instrument, he sat absorbed
in reflection.
“My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which
would decide my hopes, or realize my fears. The servants were gone to a
neighbouring fair. All was silent in and around the cottage: it was an excellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my limbs failed
me, and I sunk to the ground. Again I rose; and, exerting all the firmness
of which I was master, removed the planks which I had placed before my
hovel to conceal my retreat. The fresh air revived me, and, with renewed
determination, I approached the door of their cottage.
“I knocked. ‘Who is there?’ said the old man—‘Come in.’
“I entered; ‘Pardon this intrusion,’ said I, ‘I am a traveller in want of a
little rest; you would greatly oblige me, if you would allow me to remain a
few minutes before the fire.’
“‘Enter,’ said De Lacey; ‘and I will try in what manner I can relieve your
wants; but, unfortunately, my children are from home, and, as I am blind,
I am afraid I shall find it difficult to procure food for you.’
“‘Do not trouble yourself, my kind host, I have food; it is warmth and
rest only that I need.’
“I sat down, and a silence ensued. I knew that every minute was precious to me, yet I remained irresolute in what manner to commence the
interview; when the old man addressed me—
“‘By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my countryman;—are
you French?’
“‘No; but I was educated by a French family, and understand that language only. I am now going to claim the protection of some friends, whom I
sincerely love, and of whose favour I have some hopes.’
“‘Are these Germans?’
“‘No, they are French. But let us change the subject. I am an unfortunate
and deserted creature; I look around, and I have no relation or friend upon
earth. These amiable people to whom I go have never seen me, and know
little of me. I am full of fears; for if I fail there, I am an outcast in the world
for ever.’
112 FRANKENSTEIN
“‘Do not despair. To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate; but the
hearts of men, when unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest, are full of
brotherly love and charity. Rely, therefore, on your hopes; and if these
friends are good and amiable, do not despair.’34
“‘They are kind—they are the most excellent creatures in the world; but,
unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me. I have good dispositions; my
life has been hitherto harmless, and, in some degree, beneficial; but a fatal
prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they ought to see a feeling and kind
friend, they behold only a detestable monster.’
“‘That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless, cannot you
undeceive them?’
“‘I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account that I
feel so many overwhelming terrors. I tenderly love these friends; I have,
unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of daily kindness
towards them; but they believe that I wish to injure them, and it is that
prejudice which I wish to overcome.’
“‘Where do these friends reside?’
“‘Near this spot.’
“The old man paused, and then continued, ‘If you will unreservedly
confide to me the particulars of your tale, I perhaps may be of use in undeceiving them. I am blind, and cannot judge of your countenance, but there
is something in your words which persuades me that you are sincere. I am
poor, and an exile; but it will afford me true pleasure to be in any way serviceable to a human creature.’
“‘Excellent man! I thank you, and accept your generous offer. You raise
me from the dust by this kindness; and I trust that, by your aid, I shall not
be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow-creatures.’
34. Animal behavior has been shaped by millions of years of evolution. As animals, humans
have some behaviors that are conserved and shared with many other species. Fear, for example,
is common in the animal kingdom, and it serves a useful purpose by making sure we stay out
of dangerous situations. Similarly, selfishness, or the focus on getting the resources we need to
survive, is something life has practiced since it began. But what about love? And compassion?
What about altruism? Are humans the only creatures to do things that benefit others but don’t
directly benefit themselves? No. It turns out that altruistic behavior is observed across life—
from the prairie dog that will alert its neighbors to a nearby predator (but in doing so puts itself
at risk) to slime molds that live most of their lives as single cells but must decide to cooperate
if they are to reproduce (and in making that decision become part of the 20 percent that
sacrifice themselves). Like many other life forms, humans may be selfish at times but have a
tremendous capacity to put the needs of others before themselves. The question is, under
what circumstances?

Volume II 113
“‘Heaven forbid! even if you were really criminal; for that can only drive
you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue. I also am unfortunate; I
and my family have been condemned, although innocent: judge, therefore,
if I do not feel for your misfortunes.’
“‘How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor? from your lips
first have I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; I shall be for
ever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success with those
friends whom I am on the point of meeting.’
“‘May I know the names and residence of those friends?’
“I paused. This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to
rob me of, or bestow happiness on me for ever. I struggled vainly for firmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my remaining
strength; I sank on the chair, and sobbed aloud. At that moment I heard
the steps of my younger protectors. I had not a moment to lose; but, seizing
the hand of the old man, I cried, ‘Now is the time!—save and protect me!
You and your family are the friends whom I seek. Do not you desert me in
the hour of trial!’
“‘Great God!’ exclaimed the old man, ‘who are you?’
“At that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie, and Agatha
entered. Who can describe their horror and consternation on beholding
me? Agatha fainted; and Safie, unable to attend to her friend, rushed out
of the cottage. Felix darted forward, and with supernatural force tore me
from his father, to whose knees I clung: in a transport of fury, he dashed
me to the ground, and struck me violently with a stick. I could have torn
him limb from limb, as the lion rends the antelope. But my heart sunk
within me as with bitter sickness, and I refrained. I saw him on the point
of repeating his blow, when, overcome by pain and anguish, I quitted the
cottage, and in the general tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel.
CHAPTER VIII.
“Cursed, cursed creator! Why did I live? Why, in that instant, did I not
extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed?
I know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my feelings were
those of rage and revenge. I could with pleasure have destroyed the cottage
and its inhabitants, and have glutted myself with their shrieks and misery.
“When night came, I quitted my retreat, and wandered in the wood;
and now, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my
anguish in fearful howlings. I was like a wild beast that had broken the toils;
destroying the objects that obstructed me, and ranging through the wood 
114 FRANKENSTEIN
with a stag-like swiftness. Oh! what a miserable night I passed! the cold
stars shone in mockery, and the bare trees waved their branches above me:
now and then the sweet voice of a bird burst forth amidst the universal
stillness. All, save I, were at rest or in enjoyment: I, like the arch fiend,
bore a hell within me; and, finding myself unsympathized with, wished to
tear up the trees, spread havoc and destruction around me, and then to
have sat down and enjoyed the ruin.
“But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I became
fatigued with excess of bodily exertion, and sank on the damp grass in the
sick impotence of despair. There was none among the myriads of men that
existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness towards
my enemies? No: from that moment I declared everlasting war against the
species, and, more than all, against him who had formed me, and sent me
forth to this insupportable misery.35
“The sun rose; I heard the voices of men, and knew that it was impossible to return to my retreat during that day. Accordingly I hid myself in
some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours to reflection on my situation.
“The pleasant sunshine, and the pure air of day, restored me to some
degree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the cottage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my conclusions.
I had certainly acted imprudently. It was apparent that my conversation
had interested the father in my behalf, and I was a fool in having exposed
my person to the horror of his children. I ought to have familiarized the old
De Lacey to me, and by degrees have discovered myself to the rest of his
family, when they should have been prepared for my approach. But I did
not believe my errors to be irretrievable; and, after much consideration, I
resolved to return to the cottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him to my party.
35. In this turning point, the creature no longer figures himself as an Adam, the first being of a new
creation of humans or humanoids; rather, he opts to be like Milton’s Satan, of whom he has read.
The epic poem Paradise Lost (Milton [1667] 2007) recounts the fall of the angel Satan, who does
battle with God, is exiled from heaven, and plots his revenge against his creator with the temptation
of Adam and Eve to eat from the forbidden Tree of Knowledge. Sentenced by God to hell, Milton’s
Satan is determined to make a heaven of his hell and to revel in his punishment, which he sees as
unjust. In Mary’s story, the creature, having exhausted the limits of reason and compassion
when he receives no kindness from humans, cuts himself off from the human race and becomes
the antagonist of humankind.

Volume II 115
“These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound
sleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by peaceful
dreams. The horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever acting before
my eyes; the females were flying, and the enraged Felix tearing me from
his father’s feet. I awoke exhausted; and, finding that it was already night,
I crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in search of food.
“When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the wellknown path that conducted to the cottage. All there was at peace. I crept
into my hovel, and remained in silent expectation of the accustomed hour
when the family arose. That hour past, the sun mounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear. I trembled violently, apprehending
some dreadful misfortune. The inside of the cottage was dark, and I heard
no motion; I cannot describe the agony of this suspence.
“Presently two countrymen passed by; but, pausing near the cottage,
they entered into conversation, using violent gesticulations; but I did not
understand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country, which
differed from that of my protectors. Soon after, however, Felix approached
with another man: I was surprised, as I knew that he had not quitted the
cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover, from his discourse,
the meaning of these unusual appearances.
“‘Do you consider,’ said his companion to him, ‘that you will be obliged
to pay three months’ rent, and to lose the produce of your garden? I do not
wish to take any unfair advantage, and I beg therefore that you will take
some days to consider of your determination.’
“‘It is utterly useless,’ replied Felix, ‘we can never again inhabit your
cottage. The life of my father is in the greatest danger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related. My wife and my sister will never
recover [from] their horror. I entreat you not to reason with me any more.
Take possession of your tenement, and let me fly from this place.’
“Felix trembled violently as he said this. He and his companion entered
the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and then departed.
I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more.
“I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of utter
and stupid despair. My protectors had departed, and had broken the only
link that held me to the world. For the first time the feelings of revenge and
hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to controul them; but, allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I bent my mind towards injury
and death. When I thought of my friends, of the mild voice of De Lacey,
the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the exquisite beauty of the Arabian, these 
116 FRANKENSTEIN
thoughts vanished, and a gush of tears somewhat soothed me. But again,
when I reflected that they had spurned and deserted me, anger returned,
a rage of anger; and, unable to injure any thing human, I turned my fury
towards inanimate objects. As night advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage; and, after having destroyed every vestige of
cultivation in the garden, I waited with forced impatience until the moon
had sunk to commence my operations.
“As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods, and quickly
dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens: the blast tore along
like a mighty avalanche, and produced a kind of insanity in my spirits,
that burst all bounds of reason and reflection. I lighted the dry branch
of a tree, and danced with fury around the devoted cottage, my eyes still
fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon nearly touched. A
part of its orb was at length hid, and I waved my brand; it sunk, and, with
a loud scream, I fired the straw, and heath, and bushes, which I had collected. The wind fanned the fire, and the cottage was quickly enveloped by
the flames, which clung to it, and licked it with their forked and destroying
tongues.
“As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of
the habitation, I quitted the scene, and sought for refuge in the woods.
“And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps? I
resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated and
despised, every country must be equally horrible. At length the thought of
you crossed my mind. I learned from your papers that you were my father,
my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness than to him who
had given me life? Among the lessons that Felix had bestowed upon Safie
geography had not been omitted: I had learned from these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth. You had mentioned Geneva as
the name of your native town; and towards this place I resolved to proceed.
“But how was I to direct myself? I knew that I must travel in a southwesterly direction to reach my destination; but the sun was my only guide.
I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass through, nor could
I ask information from a single human being; but I did not despair. From
you only could I hope for succour, although towards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred. Unfeeling, heartless creator! you had endowed
me with perceptions and passions, and then cast me abroad an object for
the scorn and horror of mankind. But on you only had I any claim for pity
and redress, and from you I determined to seek that justice which I vainly
attempted to gain from any other being that wore the human form.
Volume II 117
“My travels were long, and the sufferings I endured intense. It was
late in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided. I
travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a human being.
Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless; rain and snow
poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface of the earth was
hard, and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter. Oh, earth! how often did
I imprecate curses on the cause of my being! The mildness of my nature
had fled, and all within me was turned to gall and bitterness. The nearer
I approached to your habitation, the more deeply did I feel the spirit of
revenge enkindled in my heart. Snow fell, and the waters were hardened,
but I rested not. A few incidents now and then directed me, and I possessed
a map of the country; but I often wandered wide from my path. The agony
of my feelings allowed me no respite: no incident occurred from which my
rage and misery could not extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived on the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had
recovered its warmth, and the earth again began to look green, confirmed
in an especial manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings.
“I generally rested during the day, and travelled only when I was
secured by night from the view of man. One morning, however, finding that
my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey after
the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring, cheered
even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of the air. I felt
emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long appeared dead, revive
within me. Half surprised by the novelty of these sensations, I allowed
myself to be borne away by them; and, forgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy. Soft tears again bedewed my cheeks, and I even
raised my humid eyes with thankfulness towards the blessed sun which
bestowed such joy upon me.
“I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its
boundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many of
the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring. Here I
paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard the sound
of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade of a cypress. I
was scarcely hid, when a young girl came running towards the spot where
I was concealed, laughing as if she ran from some one in sport. She continued her course along the precipitous sides of the river, when suddenly
her foot slipt, and she fell into the rapid stream. I rushed from my hiding
place, and, with extreme labour from the force of the current, saved her,
and dragged her to shore. She was senseless; and I endeavoured, by every
means in my power, to restore animation, when I was suddenly interrupted 
118 FRANKENSTEIN
by the approach of a rustic, who was probably the person from whom she
had playfully fled. On seeing me, he darted towards me, and, tearing the
girl from my arms, hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood. I followed speedily, I hardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near,
he aimed a gun, which he carried, at my body, and fired. I sunk to the
ground, and my injurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.
“This was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human
being from destruction, and, as a recompence, I now writhed under the miserable pain of a wound, which shattered the flesh and bone. The feelings
of kindness and gentleness, which I had entertained but a few moments
before, gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth. Inflamed by pain,
I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind. But the agony of my
wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted.
“For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to
cure the wound which I had received. The ball had entered my shoulder,
and I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any
rate I had no means of extracting it. My sufferings were augmented also
by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their infliction.
My daily vows rose for revenge—a deep and deadly revenge, such as would
alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had endured.
“After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey. The
labours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or
gentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery, which insulted my desolate state, and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for the
enjoyment of pleasure.
“But my toils now drew near a close; and, two months from this time, I
reached the environs of Geneva.
“It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among
the fields that surround it, to meditate in what manner I should apply to
you. I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger, and far too unhappy to enjoy
the gentle breezes of evening, or the prospect of the sun setting behind the
stupendous mountains of Jura.
“At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection, which
was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came running into
the recess I had chosen with all the sportiveness of infancy. Suddenly, as I
gazed on him, an idea seized me, that this little creature was unprejudiced,
and had lived too short a time to have imbibed a horror of deformity. If,
therefore, I could seize him, and educate him as my companion and friend,
I should not be so desolate in this peopled earth.
Volume II 119
“Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed, and drew him
towards me. As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before his
eyes, and uttered a shrill scream: I drew his hand forcibly from his face,
and said, ‘Child, what is the meaning of this? I do not intend to hurt you;
listen to me.’
“He struggled violently; ‘Let me go,’ he cried; ‘monster! ugly wretch! you
wish to eat me, and tear me to pieces—You are an ogre—Let me go, or I
will tell my papa.’
“‘Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.’
“‘Hideous monster! let me go. My papa is a Syndic—he is M. Frankenstein—he would punish you. You dare not keep me.’
“‘Frankenstein! you belong then to my enemy—to him towards whom I
have sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.’
“The child still struggled, and loaded me with epithets which carried
despair to my heart: I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a moment
he lay dead at my feet.
“I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish triumph: clapping my hands, I exclaimed, ‘I, too, can create desolation;
my enemy is not impregnable; this death will carry despair to him, and a
thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him.’
“As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his breast.
I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman. In spite of my malignity,
it softened and attracted me. For a few moments I gazed with delight on
her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her lovely lips; but presently my
rage returned: I remembered that I was for ever deprived of the delights
that such beautiful creatures could bestow; and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would, in regarding me, have changed that air of
divine benignity to one expressive of disgust and affright.
“Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage? I only
wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind, and perish in the attempt
to destroy them.
“While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had committed the murder, and was seeking a more secluded hiding-place, when I
perceived a woman passing near me. She was young, not indeed so beautiful as her whose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect, and blooming
in the loveliness of youth and health. Here, I thought, is one of those whose
smiles are bestowed on all but me; she shall not escape: thanks to the lessons of Felix, and the sanguinary laws of man, I have learned how to work
mischief. I approached her unperceived, and placed the portrait securely in
one of the folds of her dress.
120 FRANKENSTEIN
“For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place;
sometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and its
miseries for ever. At length I wandered towards these mountains, and have
ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning passion
which you alone can gratify. We may not part until you have promised to
comply with my requisition. I am alone, and miserable; man will not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself would not deny
herself to me.36 My companion must be of the same species, and have the
same defects. This being you must create.”
CHAPTER IX.
The being finished speaking, and fixed his looks upon me in expectation of
a reply. But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to arrange my ideas
sufficiently to understand the full extent of his proposition. He continued—
“You must create a female for me, with whom I can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being. This you alone can do;
and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse.”
The latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had
died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and, as
he said this, I could no longer suppress the rage that burned within me.
“I do refuse it,” I replied; “and no torture shall ever extort a consent
from me. You may render me the most miserable of men, but you shall
never make me base in my own eyes. Shall I create another like yourself,
whose joint wickedness might desolate the world. Begone! I have answered
you; you may torture me, but I will never consent.”
“You are in the wrong,” replied the fiend; “and, instead of threatening, I
am content to reason with you. I am malicious because I am miserable; am
I not shunned and hated by all mankind? You, my creator, would tear me
to pieces, and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I should pity man
more than he pities me? You would not call it murder, if you could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts, and destroy my frame, the work of your
own hands. Shall I respect man, when he contemns me? Let him live with
me in the interchange of kindness, and, instead of injury, I would bestow
every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance. But that
cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our union.
36. In furthering the parallel between Victor and the creature and elucidating Mary’s feminist themes,
the creature wants to instrumentalize the power to create life by having Victor make him a
mate who “would not deny herself to me” and would thus satisfy his own selfish feelings of longing.

Volume II 121
Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery. I will revenge my
injuries: if I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear; and chiefly towards you
my arch-enemy, because my creator, do I swear inextinguishable hatred.
Have a care: I will work at your destruction, nor finish until I desolate your
heart, so that you curse the hour of your birth.”
A fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled
into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently he
calmed himself, and proceeded—
“I intended to reason. This passion is detrimental to me; for you do not
reflect that you are the cause of its excess. If any being felt emotions of
benevolence towards me, I should return them an hundred and an hundred fold; for that one creature’s sake, I would make peace with the whole
kind! But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realized. What
I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a creature of another
sex, but as hideous as myself: the gratification is small, but it is all that I
can receive, and it shall content me. It is true, we shall be monsters, cut off
from all the world; but on that account we shall be more attached to one
another. Our lives will not be happy, but they will be harmless, and free
from the misery I now feel. Oh! my creator, make me happy; let me feel
gratitude towards you for one benefit! Let me see that I excite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my request!”
I was moved. I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences
of my consent; but I felt that there was some justice in his argument. His
tale, and the feelings he now expressed, proved him to be a creature of fine
sensations; and did I not, as his maker, owe him all the portion of happiness that it was in my power to bestow? He saw my change of feeling, and
continued—
“If you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see
us again: I will go to the vast wilds of South America. My food is not that
of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid, to glut my appetite; acorns
and berries afford me sufficient nourishment. My companion will be of the
same nature as myself, and will be content with the same fare. We shall
make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on man, and will
ripen our food. The picture I present to you is peaceful and human, and you
must feel that you could deny it only in the wantonness of power and cruelty. Pitiless as you have been towards me, I now see compassion in your
eyes; let me seize the favourable moment, and persuade you to promise
what I so ardently desire.”
“You propose,” replied I, “to fly from the habitations of man, to dwell in
those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your only companions. How 
122 FRANKENSTEIN
can you, who long for the love and sympathy37 of man, persevere in this
exile? You will return, and again seek their kindness, and you will meet
with their detestation; your evil passions will be renewed, and you will
then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction. This may not
be; cease to argue the point, for I cannot consent.”
“How inconstant are your feelings! but a moment ago you were moved
by my representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints? I swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made
me, that, with the companion you bestow, I will quit the neighbourhood
of man, and dwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of places. My evil
passions will have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy; my life will flow
quietly away, and, in my dying moments, I shall not curse my maker.”
His words had a strange effect upon me. I compassionated him, and
sometimes felt a wish to console him; but when I looked upon him, when
37. The term sympathy had multiple meanings in the early nineteenth century, some of which
resonate with scientific discourse and some with moral philosophy. The word did mean then
what we take it to mean today—a kind of entering into the feelings of another. But it also had
embodied, somatic connotations. In On Sympathy (2008), Sophie Radcliffe puts it this way:
“The uncertainty as to whether ‘sympathy’ exists as a somatic feeling in itself or as a state of mind
resulting from an act of cognition persists through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, with
terms and ideas from scientific discourses drifting into literary works and vice versa” (10).
We can see this view in a definition of the word that is now out of use but was current at the
time Mary was writing: “a relation between two bodily organs or parts (or between two persons)
such that disorder, or any condition, of the one induces a corresponding condition in the other”
(Oxford English Dictionary). There was also a question then of whether sympathy is gendered—
whether women’s minds or bodies are more readily able to engage in admirable moments of
communion of feeling as a result of their supposedly shared characteristics of body, mind, or
experience. Mothers, in particular, were imagined as having superior abilities for sympathy due
to their roles in creating, giving birth to, and raising children. Other questions were posed: Are
scientists (largely conceived of as men, as in this novel) capable of engaging in (stereotypically
feminine, maternal) sympathy? What do their scientific judgments or achievements lack if they
do not have access to the right kind or levels of sympathy, whether from lack of experience or
from supposedly biological shortcomings?
Throughout Frankenstein, invocations of “sympathy,” then, ask readers to investigate what
causes a community of feeling among people or creatures and what that feeling means in the act of
creating and nurturing new life. Does sympathy arise from the mind? Is it learned through education and the exercise of judgment? In that case, can anyone be taught it? Or does sympathy arise
from the body, whether imagined as universally “human” (in which case the creature is a liminal
kind) or as differentiated by sex or gender? Mary enters into these debates in her day and, as in this
passage, seems to suggest that sympathy fails when there is a lack of identification with the other.
This failure, as it relates to the creature, may be read as arising either from the mind or from the
body or as arising either from a somatic lack in men or from a somatic lack in humans. Mary does
not offer easy answers and leaves many questions for the reader to engage and trouble over in
considering where necessary sympathy properly comes from, how it can be exercised, and how it
has an impact on scientific discovery.

I saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened, and my
feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred. I tried to stifle these
sensations; I thought, that as I could not sympathize with him, I had no
right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which was yet
in my power to bestow.
“You swear,” I said, “to be harmless; but have you not already shewn a
degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust you? May not
even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by affording a wider
scope for your revenge?”38
“How is this? I thought I had moved your compassion, and yet you still
refuse to bestow on me the only benefit that can soften my heart, and render me harmless. If I have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must
be my portion; the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and
I shall become a thing, of whose existence every one will be ignorant. My
vices are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor; and my virtues will
necessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal. I shall feel the
affections of a sensitive being, and become linked to the chain of existence
and events, from which I am now excluded.”
I paused some time to reflect on all he had related, and the various
arguments which he had employed. I thought of the promise of virtues
which he had displayed on the opening of his existence, and the subsequent
blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors
had manifested towards him. His power and threats were not omitted in
my calculations: a creature who could exist in the ice caves of the glaciers,
and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices,
was a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with. After a long
pause of reflection, I concluded, that the justice due both to him and my
fellow-creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his request.
Turning to him, therefore, I said—
“I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe for
ever, and every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall
deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile.”
38. Victor has reason to distrust the creature. As in Aesop’s fable of the boy who cries wolf, once
trust is lost, it is difficult to rebuild. Here Victor is moved to compassion by the creature’s request,
but he remembers the evil acts the creature has performed and now wonders if he can believe
anything the creature says. Consider the research claims of scientists who have been caught in a
lie—every claim after the lie is suddenly suspect, regardless of its authenticity. For example,
Hwang Woo-suk, a Korean scientist, fraudulently claimed he had created human embryonic stem
cells through cloning, so his return to the scientific world of cloning has been reduced to the
cloning of animals.

“I swear,” he cried, “by the sun, and by the blue sky of heaven, that if
you grant my prayer, while they exist you shall never behold me again.
Depart to your home, and commence your labours: I shall watch their progress with unutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready I
shall appear.”
Saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in
my sentiments. I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than
the flight of an eagle, and quickly lost him among the undulations of the
sea of ice.
His tale had occupied the whole day; and the sun was upon the verge
of the horizon when he departed. I knew that I ought to hasten my descent
towards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my
heart was heavy, and my steps slow. The labour of winding among the little
paths of the mountains, and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced, perplexed
me, occupied as I was by the emotions which the occurrences of the day had
produced. Night was far advanced, when I came to the half-way restingplace, and seated myself beside the fountain. The stars shone at intervals,
as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines rose before me, and
every here and there a broken tree lay on the ground: it was a scene of wonderful solemnity, and stirred strange thoughts within me. I wept bitterly;
and, clasping my hands in agony, I exclaimed, “Oh! stars, and clouds, and
winds, ye are all about to mock me: if ye really pity me, crush sensation
and memory; let me become as nought; but if not, depart, depart and leave
me in darkness.”
These were wild and miserable thoughts; but I cannot describe to you
how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me, and how I listened to every blast of wind, as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its way to
consume me.
Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; but my
presence, so haggard and strange, hardly calmed the fears of my family,
who had waited the whole night in anxious expectation of my return.
The following day we returned to Geneva. The intention of my father
in coming had been to divert my mind, and to restore me to my lost tranquillity; but the medicine had been fatal. And, unable to account for the
excess of misery I appeared to suffer, he hastened to return home, hoping
the quiet and monotony of a domestic life would by degrees alleviate my
sufferings from whatsoever cause they might spring.
For myself, I was passive in all their arrangements; and the gentle
affection of my beloved Elizabeth was inadequate to draw me from the 
Volume II 125
depth of my despair. The promise I had made to the dæmon weighed upon
my mind, like Dante’s iron cowl on the heads of the hellish hypocrites.
All pleasures of earth and sky passed before me like a dream, and that
thought only had to me the reality of life. Can you wonder, that sometimes
a kind of insanity possessed me, or that I saw continually about me a multitude of filthy animals inflicting on me incessant torture, that often extorted
screams and bitter groans?
By degrees, however, these feelings became calmed. I entered again into
the every-day scene of life, if not with interest, at least with some degree
of tranquillity.
END OF VOL. II.
VOL. III
CHAPTER I.
Day after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Geneva; and
I could not collect the courage to recommence my work. I feared the vengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my repugnance to the task which was enjoined me.1
 I found that I could not compose
a female without again devoting several months to profound study and
laborious disquisition. I had heard of some discoveries having been made
by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which was material to my
success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my father’s consent to visit
England for this purpose; but I clung to every pretence of delay, and could
not resolve to interrupt my returning tranquillity. My health, which had
hitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when unchecked
by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably. My father saw
this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts towards the best
method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy, which every now and
then would return by fits, and with a devouring blackness overcast the
approaching sunshine. At these moments I took refuge in the most perfect
solitude. I passed whole days on the lake alone in a little boat, watching
the clouds, and listening to the rippling of the waves, silent and listless.
But the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree
of composure; and, on my return, I met the salutations of my friends with
a readier smile and a more cheerful heart.
It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father, calling me aside, thus addressed me:—
“I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former pleasures, and seem to be returning to yourself. And yet you are still
unhappy, and still avoid our society. For some time I was lost in conjecture
as to the cause of this; but yesterday an idea struck me, and if it is well
founded, I conjure you to avow it. Reserve on such a point would be not only
useless, but draw down treble misery on us all.”
1. Victor and his interlocutor, Walton, appear to consider courage to be one of the more mechanical
human attributes, one that is shared by some of the lower animals. To be courageous is a means
to an end rather than something to be admired in and of itself, or Victor would doubtless have had
greater admiration for the creature he creates, and Walton would have found a friend among the
sailors of dauntless courage he hired in St. Petersburg. It is Victor’s lack of courage that drives the
plot for most of the novel. He finds himself motivated to action or inaction by fear, revulsion,
and rage but never by courage. If he had the courage to deal directly with the consequences of his
experiment, how much pain and grief could have been avoided?

128 FRANKENSTEIN
I trembled violently at this exordium, and my father continued—
“I confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your marriage
with your cousin as the tie of our domestic comfort, and the stay of my
declining years. You were attached to each other from your earliest infancy;
you studied together, and appeared, in dispositions and tastes, entirely
suited to one another. But so blind is the experience of man, that what I
conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have entirely destroyed
it. You, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any wish that she might
become your wife. Nay, you may have met with another whom you may
love; and, considering yourself as bound in honour to your cousin, this
struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear to feel.”
“My dear father, re-assure yourself. I love my cousin tenderly and sincerely. I never saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, my warmest admiration and affection. My future hopes and prospects are entirely
bound up in the expectation of our union.”
“The expression of your sentiments on this subject, my dear Victor, gives
me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced. If you feel thus,
we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast a gloom
over us. But it is this gloom, which appears to have taken so strong a
hold of your mind, that I wish to dissipate. Tell me, therefore, whether you
object to an immediate solemnization of the marriage. We have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us from that every-day tranquillity
befitting my years and infirmities. You are younger; yet I do not suppose,
possessed as you are of a competent fortune, that an early marriage would
at all interfere with any future plans of honour and utility that you may
have formed. Do not suppose, however, that I wish to dictate happiness to
you, or that a delay on your part would cause me any serious uneasiness.
Interpret my words with candour, and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and sincerity.”
I listened to my father in silence, and remained for some time incapable of offering any reply. I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of
thoughts, and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion. Alas! to me the
idea of an immediate union with my cousin was one of horror and dismay. I
was bound by a solemn promise, which I had not yet fulfilled, and dared not
break; or, if I did, what manifold miseries might not impend over me and
my devoted family! Could I enter into a festival with this deadly weight yet
hanging round my neck, and bowing me to the ground. I must perform my
engagement, and let the monster depart with his mate, before I allowed
myself to enjoy the delight of an union from which I expected peace.
Volume III 129
I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying
to England, or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers
of that country, whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable
use to me in my present undertaking. The latter method of obtaining the
desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory: besides, any variation
was agreeable to me, and I was delighted with the idea of spending a year
or two in change of scene and variety of occupation, in absence from my
family; during which period some event might happen which would restore
me to them in peace and happiness: my promise might be fulfilled, and the
monster have departed; or some accident might occur to destroy him, and
put an end to my slavery for ever.
These feelings dictated my answer to my father. I expressed a wish to
visit England; but, concealing the true reasons of this request, I clothed my
desires under the guise of wishing to travel and see the world before I sat
down for life within the walls of my native town.
I urged my entreaty with earnestness, and my father was easily
induced to comply; for a more indulgent and less dictatorial parent did not
exist upon earth. Our plan was soon arranged. I should travel to Strasburgh, where Clerval would join me. Some short time would be spent in the
towns of Holland, and our principal stay would be in England. We should
return by France; and it was agreed that the tour should occupy the space
of two years.
My father pleased himself with the reflection, that my union with
Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return to Geneva. “These
two years,” said he, “will pass swiftly, and it will be the last delay that will
oppose itself to your happiness. And, indeed, I earnestly desire that period
to arrive, when we shall all be united, and neither hopes or fears arise to
disturb our domestic calm.”
“I am content,” I replied, “with your arrangement. By that time we shall
both have become wiser, and I hope happier, than we at present are.” I
sighed; but my father kindly forbore to question me further concerning the
cause of my dejection, He hoped that new scenes, and the amusement of
travelling, would restore my tranquillity.
I now made arrangements for my journey; but one feeling haunted me,
which filled me with fear and agitation. During my absence I should leave
my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy, and unprotected
from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my departure. But he had
promised to follow me wherever I might go; and would he not accompany
me to England? This imagination was dreadful in itself, but soothing, inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends. I was agonized with the idea 
130 FRANKENSTEIN
of the possibility that the reverse of this might happen. But through the
whole period during which I was the slave of my creature, I allowed myself
to be governed by the impulses of the moment;2
 and my present sensations
strongly intimated that the fiend would follow me, and exempt my family
from the danger of his machinations.
It was in the latter end of August that I departed, to pass two years of
exile. Elizabeth approved of the reasons of my departure, and only regretted that she had not the same opportunities of enlarging her experience,
and cultivating her understanding.3
 She wept, however, as she bade me
farewell, and entreated me to return happy and tranquil. “We all,” said she,
“depend upon you; and if you are miserable, what must be our feelings?”
I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly
knowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around. I
remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on it, to
order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with me: for I
resolved to fulfil my promise while abroad, and return, if possible, a free
man. Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful
and majestic scenes; but my eyes were fixed and unobserving. I could only
think of the bourne of my travels, and the work which was to occupy me
whilst they endured.
After some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed
many leagues, I arrived at Strasburgh, where I waited two days for Clerval.
He came. Alas, how great was the contrast between us! He was alive to
every new scene; joyful when he saw the beauties of the setting sun, and
more happy when he beheld it rise, and recommence a new day. He pointed
out to me the shifting colours of the landscape, and the appearances of the
sky. “This is what it is to live”; he cried, “now I enjoy existence! But you,
my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are you desponding and sorrowful?”
2. As a slave, Victor has lost the capacity to reason through problems and is instead “governed by
the impulses of the moment.” He recognizes the phenomenon in himself—that one’s capacities
are shaped by one’s social position and relations—but he does not reflect fully on that recognition
and allow for it to influence his assessment of the creature.
David H. Guston.
3. In this passage, Mary could be reflecting on her own situation and the social pressures that
might have hemmed her in. In theory, Elizabeth could choose, like Mary with Percy, to accompany
her paramour in his travels, but in reality her obligations as the woman of Alphonse’s house
and her bourgeois upbringing make that choice impossible. Other logical possibilities—for example, Elizabeth proposing to Victor that they marry and take the trip together as a honeymoon—
are also social impossibilities.

Volume III 131
In truth, I was occupied by gloomy thoughts, and neither saw the descent
of the evening star, nor the golden sun-rise reflected in the Rhine.—And
you, my friend, would be far more amused with the journal of Clerval, who
observed the scenery with an eye of feeling and delight, than to listen to my
reflections. I, a miserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every
avenue to enjoyment.
We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasburgh to Rotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London. During this voyage, we
passed by many willowy islands, and saw several beautiful towns. We staid
a day at Manheim, and, on the fifth from our departure from Strasburgh,
arrived at Mayence. The course of the Rhine below Mayence becomes much
more picturesque. The river descends rapidly, and winds between hills, not
high, but steep, and of beautiful forms. We saw many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by black woods, high and inaccessible. This part of the Rhine, indeed, presents a singularly variegated
landscape. In one spot you view rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking
tremendous precipices, with the dark Rhine rushing beneath; and, on the
sudden turn of a promontory, flourishing vineyards, with green sloping
banks, and a meandering river, and populous towns, occupy the scene.
We travelled at the time of the vintage, and heard the song of the
labourers, as we glided down the stream. Even I, depressed in mind, and
my spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I lay
at the bottom of the boat, and, as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed
to drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger. And if these
were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt as if he had
been transported to Fairy-land, and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by
man. “I have seen,” he said, “the most beautiful scenes of my own country;
I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the snowy mountains
descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black and impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance, were it
not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay appearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore up
whirlwinds of water, and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must
be on the great ocean, and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain, where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche,
and where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of
the nightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays
de Vaud: but this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders.
The mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange; but there is
a charm in the banks of this divine river, that I never before saw equalled. 
132 FRANKENSTEIN
Look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the
island, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now
that group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village
half-hid in the recess of the mountain. Oh, surely, the spirit that inhabits
and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man, than those
who pile the glacier, or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of
our own country.”
Clerval! beloved friend! even now it delights me to record your words,
and to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving. He was
a being formed in the “very poetry of nature.”4
 His wild and enthusiastic
imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart. His soul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that devoted and
wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to look for only in the
imagination. But even human sympathies were not sufficient to satisfy his
eager mind. The scenery of external nature, which others regard only with
admiration, he loved with ardour:
—————“The sounding cataract
Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock,
The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,
Their colours and their forms, were then to him
An appetite; a feeling, and a love,
That had no need of a remoter charm,
By thought supplied, or any interest
Unborrowed from the eye.” 5
And where does he now exist? Is this gentle and lovely being lost for
ever? Has this mind so replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful and magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the life of its
creator; has this mind perished? Does it now only exist in my memory? No,
it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and beaming with beauty, has
decayed, but your spirit still visits and consoles your unhappy friend.
Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight
tribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart, overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates. I will proceed
with my tale.

Beyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we resolved
to post the remainder of our way; for the wind was contrary, and the stream
of the river was too gentle to aid us.
Our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery; but
we arrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to
England. It was on a clear morning, in the latter days of September, that I
first saw the white cliffs of Britain. The banks of the Thames presented a
new scene; they were flat, but fertile, and almost every town was marked
by the remembrance of some story. We saw Tilbury Fort, and remembered
the Spanish armada; Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich, places which
I had heard of even in my country.
At length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Paul’s towering
above all, and the Tower famed in English history.
CHAPTER II.
London was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several
months in this wonderful and celebrated city. Clerval desired the intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this time; but this
was with me a secondary object; I was principally occupied with the means
of obtaining the information necessary for the completion of my promise,
and quickly availed myself of the letters of introduction that I had brought
with me, addressed to the most distinguished natural philosophers.6
If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness, it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure. But a blight had
come over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of the
information they might give me on the subject in which my interest was
so terribly profound. Company was irksome to me; when alone, I could fill
my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of Henry soothed
me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace. But busy uninteresting joyous faces brought back despair to my heart. I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my fellow-men; this barrier was
sealed with the blood of William and Justine; and to reflect on the events
connected with those names filled my soul with anguish.
6. Among these leading natural philosophers of the period were William Nicholson (1753–1815),
whom Mary’s father, William Godwin, often turned to for scientific advice, and Humphry Davy
(1778–1829), a young chemist who would dazzle London and the scientific world from the era in
which Frankenstein is set to Mary’s own. Davy was a frequent guest at the Godwin house
during Mary’s childhood and was part of an important ongoing conversation with Godwin and the
poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge about the relationship between science, creativity, and poetry.

But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive,
and anxious to gain experience and instruction. The difference of manners
which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of instruction and
amusement. He was for ever busy; and the only check to his enjoyments
was my sorrowful and dejected mien. I tried to conceal this as much as
possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures natural to one
who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by any care or bitter
recollection. I often refused to accompany him, alleging another engagement, that I might remain alone. I now also began to collect the materials
necessary for my new creation, and this was to me like the torture of single
drops of water continually falling on the head. Every thought that was
devoted to it was an extreme anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips to quiver, and my heart to palpitate.
After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a
person in Scotland, who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva. He mentioned the beauties of his native country, and asked us if those were not
sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as
Perth, where he resided. Clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation;
and I, although I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and
streams, and all the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen
dwelling-places.
We had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now
February. We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards
the north at the expiration of another month. In this expedition we did not
intend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford,
Matlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of
this tour about the end of July. I packed my chemical instruments, and the
materials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some obscure
nook in the northern highlands of Scotland.
We quitted London on the 27th of March, and remained a few days at
Windsor, rambling in its beautiful forest. This was a new scene to us mountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of stately
deer, were all novelties to us.
From thence we proceeded to Oxford. As we entered this city, our minds
were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted
there more than a century and a half before. It was here that Charles I. had
collected his forces. This city had remained faithful to him, after the whole
nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of parliament and liberty. The memory of that unfortunate king, and his companions, the amiable
Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and son, gave a peculiar interest 
Volume III 135
to every part of the city, which they might be supposed to have inhabited.
The spirit of elder days found a dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its
footsteps. If these feelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the
appearance of the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration. The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost
magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows of
exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters, which
reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and domes, embosomed among aged trees.
I enjoyed this scene; and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the
memory of the past, and the anticipation of the future. I was formed for
peaceful happiness. During my youthful days discontent never visited my
mind; and if I was ever overcome by ennui, the sight of what is beautiful
in nature, or the study of what is excellent and sublime in the productions of man, could always interest my heart, and communicate elasticity
to my spirits. But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has entered my soul; and I
felt then that I should survive to exhibit, what I shall soon cease to be—a
miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity, pitiable to others, and abhorrent
to myself.
We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs, and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the
most animating epoch of English history. Our little voyages of discovery
were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves.
We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden, and the field on which
that patriot fell. For a moment my soul was elevated from its debasing and
miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and self-sacrifice,
of which these sights were the monuments and the remembrancers. For an
instant I dared to shake off my chains, and look around me with a free and
lofty spirit; but the iron had eaten into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my miserable self.
We left Oxford with regret, and proceeded to Matlock, which was our
next place of rest. The country in the neighbourhood of this village resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but every thing is
on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of distant white Alps,
which always attend on the piny mountains of my native country. We visited the wondrous cave, and the little cabinets of natural history, where the
curiosities are disposed in the same manner as in the collections at Servox
and Chamounix. The latter name made me tremble, when pronounced by
Henry; and I hastened to quit Matlock, with which that terrible scene was
thus associated.
136 FRANKENSTEIN
From Derby still journeying northward, we passed two months in
Cumberland and Westmoreland. I could now almost fancy myself among
the Swiss mountains. The little patches of snow which yet lingered on
the northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the
rocky streams, were all familiar and dear sights to me. Here also we made
some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into happiness.
The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than mine; his mind
expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found in his own nature
greater capacities and resources than he could have imagined himself to
have possessed while he associated with his inferiors. “I could pass my life
here,” said he to me; “and among these mountains I should scarcely regret
Switzerland and the Rhine.”
But he found that a traveller’s life is one that includes much pain amid
its enjoyments. His feelings are for ever on the stretch; and when he begins
to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit that on which he rests
in pleasure for something new, which again engages his attention, and
which also he forsakes for other novelties.
We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmoreland, and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants, when the
period of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left
them to travel on. For my own part I was not sorry. I had now neglected
my promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the dæmon’s disappointment. He might remain in Switzerland, and wreak his vengeance on
my relatives. This idea pursued me, and tormented me at every moment
from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace. I waited
for my letters with feverish impatience: if they were delayed, I was miserable, and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived, and I saw
the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to read and
ascertain my fate. Sometimes I thought that the fiend followed me, and
might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion. When these
thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment, but followed
him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of his destroyer.
I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the consciousness of which
haunted me. I was guiltless, but I had indeed drawn down a horrible curse
upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.7
7. Victor gives expression to his conflicting feelings. His conscience haunts him for the crime he
feels he has committed. But he confesses his innocence—an ironic juxtaposition with Justine’s
untruthful confession of guilt. In part, this passage expresses the difficulty of conscience serving
as a reliable guide. Do feelings serve as a better source of moral discernment?

Volume III 137
I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might
have interested the most unfortunate being. Clerval did not like it so well
as Oxford; for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him.
But the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic
castle, and its environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthur’s Seat, St.
Bernard’s Well, and the Pentland Hills, compensated him for the change,
and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. But I was impatient to
arrive at the termination of my journey.
We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrews,
and along the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us. But
I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers, or enter into their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and accordingly
I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland alone. “Do you,”
said I, “enjoy yourself, and let this be our rendezvous. I may be absent a
month or two; but do not interfere with my motions, I entreat you: leave
me to peace and solitude for a short time; and when I return, I hope it will
be with a lighter heart, more congenial to your own temper.”
Henry wished to dissuade me; but, seeing me bent on this plan, ceased
to remonstrate. He entreated me to write often. “I had rather be with you,”
he said, “in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch people, whom I
do not know: hasten then, my dear friend, to return, that I may again feel
myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in your absence.”
Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot
of Scotland, and finish my work in solitude. I did not doubt but that the
monster followed me, and would discover himself to me when I should
have finished, that he might receive his companion.
With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands, and fixed on
one of the remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours. It was a
place fitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock, whose high
sides were continually beaten upon by the waves. The soil was barren,
scarcely affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its
inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy
limbs gave tokens of their miserable fare. Vegetables and bread, when they
indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from
the main land, which was about five miles distant.
On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one
of these was vacant when I arrived. This I hired. It contained but two
rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable penury. The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the door
was off its hinges. I ordered it to be repaired, bought some furniture, and 
138 FRANKENSTEIN
took possession; an incident which would, doubtless, have occasioned some
surprise, had not all the senses of the cottagers been benumbed by want
and squalid poverty. As it was, I lived ungazed at and unmolested, hardly
thanked for the pittance of food and clothes which I gave; so much does
suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations of men.
In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening,
when the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea, to
listen to the waves as they roared, and dashed at my feet. It was a monotonous, yet ever-changing scene. I thought of Switzerland; it was far different from this desolate and appalling landscape. Its hills are covered
with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the plains. Its fair
lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky; and, when troubled by the winds, their
tumult is but as the play of a lively infant, when compared to the roarings
of the giant ocean.
In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived; but,
as I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and irksome to me. Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my laboratory for several days; and at other times I toiled day and night in order to
complete my work. It was indeed a filthy process in which I was engaged.
During my first experiment, a kind of enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me
to the horror of my employment; my mind was intently fixed on the sequel
of my labour, and my eyes were shut to the horror of my proceedings. But
now I went to it in cold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of
my hands.
Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed
in a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from the
actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I grew
restless and nervous. Every moment I feared to meet my persecutor. Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing to raise them lest they
should encounter the object which I so much dreaded to behold. I feared to
wander from the sight of my fellow-creatures, lest when alone he should
come to claim his companion.
In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably advanced. I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager
hope, which I dared not trust myself to question, but which was intermixed
with obscure forebodings of evil, that made my heart sicken in my bosom.
CHAPTER III.
I sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was
just rising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment, and 
Volume III 139
I remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my
labour for the night, or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention
to it. As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to me, which led me to consider
the effects of what I was now doing. Three years before I was engaged in
the same manner, and had created a fiend whose unparalleled barbarity
had desolated my heart, and filled it for ever with the bitterest remorse.
I was now about to form another being, of whose dispositions I was alike
ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her
mate, and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness. He had
sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man, and hide himself in deserts; but
she had not; and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and
reasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before her
creation. They might even hate each other; the creature who already lived
loathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence
for it when it came before his eyes in the female form? She also might
turn with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit
him, and he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being
deserted by one of his own species.8
Even if they were to leave Europe, and inhabit the deserts of the new
world, yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the dæmon
thirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated
upon the earth, who might make the very existence of the species of man
a condition precarious and full of terror. Had I a right, for my own benefit,
to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations? I had before been moved
by the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck senseless
by his fiendish threats: but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my
promise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse
8. For Mary, the daughter of early feminist philosopher Mary Wollstonecraft, women’s status as
“the other” was painfully and personally obvious. Men ruled the world, and therefore almost every
philosophical, scientific, and political tract about the meaning of selfhood assumed that the “self”
is male. Women’s experiences were considered at best irrelevant and at worst monstrous. It is
therefore delightfully sneaky that Mary has figured out a way to turn the female perspective into
something more relatable than the male, as Victor imagines his new creation—“a thinking and
reasoning animal”—asserting her own will in the face of the first creature’s desire. Victor is also
forced to imagine the creature’s perspective as he looks for the first time into the eyes of “his own
species.” When Victor imagines the two creatures looking upon each other for the first time, he
calls to mind Jean-Paul Sartre’s classic notion that humans learn selfhood when we are first seen
by the “other.” In Being and Nothingness ([1943] 2012), Sartre argues that we cannot have a self
until we are recognized by an other, which allows us to see both the other in ourselves and the
selfhood in others. Victor typically cannot imagine the two creatures having selves at all. So he
suggests they will be “repulsed” rather than find sympathy in one another’s eyes.

me as their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace
at the price perhaps of the existence of the whole human race.9
I trembled, and my heart failed within me; when, on looking up, I saw,
by the light of the moon, the dæmon at the casement. A ghastly grin wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task which he had
allotted to me. Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide and desert heaths; and
he now came to mark my progress, and claim the fulfilment of my promise.
As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of
malice and treachery. I thought with a sensation of madness on my promise of creating another like to him, and, trembling with passion, tore to
pieces the thing on which I was engaged. The wretch saw me destroy the
creature on whose future existence he depended for happiness, and, with a
howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.
I left the room, and, locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own
heart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I sought
my own apartment. I was alone; none were near me to dissipate the gloom,
and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most terrible reveries.
Several hours past, and I remained near my window gazing on the
sea; it was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature
reposed under the eye of the quiet moon. A few fishing vessels alone
specked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound of
voices, as the fishermen called to one another. I felt the silence, although I
was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear was suddenly
arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a person landed close
to my house.
In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one
endeavoured to open it softly. I trembled from head to foot; I felt a presentiment of who it was, and wished to rouse one of the peasants who dwelt in a
cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation of helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain endeavour to fly
from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot.
9. Pondering the unknowns and potential horrors the future mate for the creature might perpetrate, Victor thinks through these possibilities and resolves not to continue his efforts. Perhaps
overestimating his creative prowess, he now recognizes that his own selfishness might result
in the destruction of the whole human race. Although some emotions may prove reliable guides
for behavior, selfishness is never appropriate because it leads only to destruction, be it of the
self or of others.
Joel Gereboff.
Volume III 141
Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door
opened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared. Shutting the door, he
approached me, and said, in a smothered voice—
“You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you
intend? Do you dare to break your promise? I have endured toil and misery:
I left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among
its willow islands, and over the summits of its hills. I have dwelt many
months in the heaths of England, and among the deserts of Scotland. I
have endured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare
destroy my hopes?”
“Begone! I do break my promise; never will I create another like yourself, equal in deformity and wickedness.”
“Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself unworthy of my condescension. Remember that I have power; you believe yourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of day will be
hateful to you. You are my creator, but I am your master;—obey!”10
“The hour of my weakness is past, and the period of your power is
arrived. Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but they
confirm me in a resolution of not creating you a companion in vice. Shall I,
in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a dæmon, whose delight is in death
and wretchedness. Begone! I am firm, and your words will only exasperate
my rage.”
The monster saw my determination in my face, and gnashed his teeth
in the impotence of anger. “Shall each man,” cried he, “find a wife for
his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone? I had feelings
of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn. Man, you
may hate; but beware! Your hours will pass in dread and misery, and
soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for ever.
10. A great deal is going on in this paragraph. First, the creature continues to speak as though he
has adopted the mantle of Milton’s Satan: “I before reasoned with you” evokes Isaiah’s “Come, let us
reason together” (1.18), a biblical voice that echoes in a great deal of Satan’s language in Paradise
Lost (Milton [1667] 2007). Second, the creature has a sophisticated understanding of Victor’s psychology and social context, perhaps more so than Victor does, in his claim that he can render Victor
even more miserable than he is. Third, even as Victor manages to achieve some measure of foresight and the ability to view a situation from a perspective other than his own (importantly, from the
female creature’s perspective; see note 6), the creature has understood that his physical prowess
has utterly transformed the dynamic between them. This inversion of the master–slave relationship
is every slave master’s fear and perhaps the reason why, for example, the novel was banned in
apartheid South Africa and why it has become such a fertile source for narratives on robotics and
artificial intelligence. Victor must have some measure of physical courage to stand up to the creature here, but does he have moral courage as well?
David H. Guston.
142 FRANKENSTEIN
Are you to be happy, while I grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness?
You can blast my other passions; but revenge remains—revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food! I may die; but first you, my tyrant and
tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your misery. Beware; for I am
fearless, and therefore powerful. I will watch with the wiliness of a snake,
that I may sting with its venom. Man, you shall repent of the injuries you
inflict.”
“Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice. I
have declared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend beneath
words. Leave me; I am inexorable.”
“It is well. I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your wedding-night.”
I started forward, and exclaimed, “Villain! before you sign my deathwarrant, be sure that you are yourself safe.”
I would have seized him; but he eluded me, and quitted the house with
precipitation: in a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot across
the waters with an arrowy swiftness, and was soon lost amid the waves.
All was again silent; but his words rung in my ears. I burned with rage
to pursue the murderer of my peace, and precipitate him into the ocean. I
walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination conjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me. Why had I
not followed him, and closed with him in mortal strife? But I had suffered
him to depart, and he had directed his course towards the main land. I
shuddered to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate
revenge. And then I thought again of his words—“I will be with you on
your wedding-night.” That then was the period fixed for the fulfilment of
my destiny. In that hour I should die, and at once satisfy and extinguish
his malice. The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I thought of my
beloved Elizabeth,—of her tears and endless sorrow, when she should find
her lover so barbarously snatched from her,—tears, the first I had shed for
many months, streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall before my
enemy without a bitter struggle.
The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings
became calmer, if it may be called calmness, when the violence of rage
sinks into the depths of despair. I left the house, the horrid scene of the
last night’s contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I almost
regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow-creatures;
nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me. I desired that
I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily it is true, but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. If I returned, it was to be sacrificed,
or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a dæmon whom I
had myself created.
Volume III 143
I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it
loved, and miserable in the separation. When it became noon, and the sun
rose higher, I lay down on the grass, and was overpowered by a deep sleep.
I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery. The sleep into which
I now sunk refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as if I belonged
to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to reflect upon what
had passed with greater composure; yet still the words of the fiend rung
in my ears like a death-knell, they appeared like a dream, yet distinct and
oppressive as a reality.
The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my
appetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a
fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet; it
contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval, entreating me to join
him. He said that nearly a year had elapsed since we had quitted Switzerland, and France was yet unvisited. He entreated me, therefore, to leave
my solitary isle, and meet him at Perth, in a week from that time, when we
might arrange the plan of our future proceedings. This letter in a degree
recalled me to life, and I determined to quit my island at the expiration of
two days.
Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered to reflect: I must pack my chemical instruments; and for that purpose
I must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I
must handle those utensils, the sight of which was sickening to me. The
next morning, at day-break, I summoned sufficient courage, and unlocked
the door of my laboratory. The remains of the half-finished creature, whom
I had destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had
mangled the living flesh of a human being. I paused to collect myself, and
then entered the chamber. With trembling hands I conveyed the instruments out of the room; but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of
my work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants, and I accordingly put them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying
them up, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in
the mean time I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging
my chemical apparatus.
Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken
place in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the dæmon. I had
before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair, as a thing that, with
whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film had
been taken from before my eyes, and that I, for the first time, saw clearly. 
144 FRANKENSTEIN
The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur to me; the
threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not reflect that a
voluntary act of mine could avert it. I had resolved in my own mind, that
to create another like the fiend I had first made would be an act of the
basest and most atrocious selfishness; and I banished from my mind every
thought that could lead to a different conclusion.
Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the
shore. The scene was perfectly solitary: a few boats were returning towards
land, but I sailed away from them. I felt as if I was about the commission
of a dreadful crime, and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter
with my fellow-creatures. At one time the moon, which had before been
clear, was suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of
the moment of darkness, and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the
gurgling sound as it sunk, and then sailed away from the spot. The sky
became clouded; but the air was pure, although chilled by the north-east
breeze that was then rising. But it refreshed me, and filled me with such
agreeable sensations, that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and
fixing the rudder in a direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the
boat. Clouds hid the moon, every thing was obscure, and I heard only the
sound of the boat, as its keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me,
and in a short time I slept soundly.
I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke
I found that the sun had already mounted considerably. The wind was
high, and the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. I
found that the wind was north-east, and must have driven me far from the
coast from which I had embarked. I endeavoured to change my course, but
quickly found that if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly
filled with water. Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the
wind. I confess that I felt a few sensations of terror. I had no compass with
me, and was so little acquainted with the geography of this part of the
world that the sun was of little benefit to me. I might be driven into the
wide Atlantic, and feel all the tortures of starvation, or be swallowed up
in the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me. I had
already been out many hours, and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a
prelude to my other sufferings. I looked on the heavens, which were covered
by clouds that flew before the wind only to be replaced by others: I looked
upon the sea, it was to be my grave. “Fiend,” I exclaimed, “your task is
already fulfilled!” I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and of Clerval; and 
Volume III 145
sunk into a reverie, so despairing and frightful, that even now, when the
scene is on the point of closing before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it.
Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards
the horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze, and the sea became
free from breakers. But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick, and
hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high land
towards the south.
Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue, and the dreadful suspense I endured
for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of warm
joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.
How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love
we have of life even in the excess of misery! I constructed another sail
with a part of my dress, and eagerly steered my course towards the land.
It had a wild and rocky appearance; but as I approached nearer, I easily
perceived the traces of cultivation. I saw vessels near the shore, and found
myself suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilized man.
I eagerly traced the windings of the land, and hailed a steeple which I at
length saw issuing from behind a small promontory. As I was in a state
of extreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town as a place
where I could most easily procure nourishment. Fortunately I had money
with me. As I turned the promontory, I perceived a small neat town and
a good harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected escape.
As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several
people crowded towards the spot. They seemed very much surprised at my
appearance; but, instead of offering me any assistance, whispered together
with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me a slight
sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they spoke English;
and I therefore addressed them in that language: “My good friends,” said
I, “will you be so kind as to tell me the name of this town, and inform me
where I am?”
“You will know that soon enough,” replied a man with a gruff voice. “May
be you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste; but you
will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you.”
I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a
stranger; and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and angry
countenances of his companions. “Why do you answer me so roughly?” I
replied: “surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to receive strangers so
inhospitably.”
146 FRANKENSTEIN
“I do not know,” said the man, “what the custom of the English may be;
but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains.”
While this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly
increase. Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which
annoyed, and in some degree alarmed me. I inquired the way to the inn;
but no one replied. I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose
from the crowd as they followed and surrounded me; when an ill-looking
man approaching, tapped me on the shoulder, and said, “Come, Sir, you
must follow me to Mr. Kirwin’s, to give an account of yourself.”
“Who is Mr. Kirwin? Why am I to give an account of myself? Is not this
a free country?”
“Aye, Sir, free enough for honest folks. Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate; and
you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was found murdered here last night.”
This answer startled me; but I presently recovered myself. I was innocent; that could easily be proved: accordingly I followed my conductor in
silence, and was led to one of the best houses in the town. I was ready to
sink from fatigue and hunger; but, being surrounded by a crowd, I thought
it politic to rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into apprehension or conscious guilt. Little did I then expect the
calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me, and extinguish in
horror and despair all fear of ignominy or death.
I must pause here; for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory
of the frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to my
recollection.
CHAPTER IV.
I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old benevolent man, with calm and mild manners. He looked upon me, however, with
some degree of severity; and then, turning towards my conductors, he
asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.
About half a dozen men came forward; and one being selected by the
magistrate, he deposed, that he had been out fishing the night before with
his son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o’clock, they
observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in for
port. It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did not
land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about
two miles below. He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle,
and his companions followed him at some distance. As he was proceeding 
Volume III 147
along the sands, he struck his foot against something, and fell all his length
on the ground. His companions came up to assist him; and, by the light of
their lantern, they found that he had fallen on the body of a man, who was
to all appearance dead. Their first supposition was, that it was the corpse
of some person who had been drowned, and was thrown on shore by the
waves; but, upon examination, they found that the clothes were not wet,
and even that the body was not then cold. They instantly carried it to the
cottage of an old woman near the spot, and endeavoured, but in vain, to
restore it to life. He appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and
twenty years of age. He had apparently been strangled; for there was no
sign of any violence, except the black mark of fingers on his neck.
The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me; but
when the mark of the fingers was mentioned, I remembered the murder of
my brother, and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a
mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for support.
The magistrate observed me with a keen eye, and of course drew an unfavourable augury from my manner,
The son confirmed his father’s account: but when Daniel Nugent was
called, he swore positively that, just before the fall of his companion, he
saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore; and,
as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same boat in
which I had just landed.
A woman deposed, that she lived near the beach, and was standing at
the door of her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an
hour before she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat,
with only one man in it, push off from that part of the shore where the
corpse was afterwards found.
Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought
the body into her house; it was not cold. They put it into a bed, and rubbed
it; and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was quite gone.
Several other men were examined concerning my landing; and they
agreed, that, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night,
it was very probable that I had beaten about for many hours, and had
been obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed.
Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body from
another place, and it was likely, that as I did not appear to know the shore,
I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the town of
——— from the place where I had deposited the corpse.
Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken
into the room where the body lay for interment that it might be observed 
148 FRANKENSTEIN
what effect the sight of it would produce upon me. This idea was probably
suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the
murder had been described. I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate and several other persons, to the inn. I could not help being struck by
the strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night;
but, knowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the island
I had inhabited about the time that the body had been found, I was perfectly tranquil as to the consequences of the affair.
I entered the room where the corpse lay, and was led up to the coffin.
How can I describe my sensations on beholding it? I feel yet parched with
horror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and
agony, that faintly reminds me of the anguish of the recognition. The trial,
the presence of the magistrate and witnesses, passed like a dream from my
memory, when I saw the lifeless form of Henry Clerval stretched before me.
I gasped for breath; and, throwing myself on the body, I exclaimed, “Have
my murderous machinations deprived you also, my dearest Henry, of life?
Two I have already destroyed; other victims await their destiny: but you,
Clerval, my friend, my benefactor”——
The human frame could no longer support the agonizing suffering that
I endured, and I was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.
A fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of death: my
ravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the murderer
of William, of Justine, and of Clerval. Sometimes I entreated my attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was tormented;
and, at others, I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping my neck,
and screamed aloud with agony and terror. Fortunately, as I spoke my
native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and
bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.
Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did
I not sink into forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming children, the only hopes of their doating parents: how many brides and
youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the
next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! Of what materials was
I made, that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of
the wheel, continually renewed the torture.
But I was doomed to live; and, in two months, found myself as awaking from a dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by
gaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon. It
was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding: I had forgotten the particulars of what had happened, and only felt as if some great 
Volume III 149
misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around, and
saw the barred windows, and the squalidness of the room in which I was,
all flashed across my memory, and I groaned bitterly.
This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside
me. She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterize that class.
The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of persons accustomed
to see without sympathizing in sights of misery. Her tone expressed her
entire indifference; she addressed me in English, and the voice struck me
as one that I had heard during my sufferings:
“Are you better now, Sir?” said she.
I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, “I believe I am; but
if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am still alive to
feel this misery and horror.”
“For that matter,” replied the old woman, “if you mean about the gentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you were dead,
for I fancy it will go hard with you; but you will be hung when the next
sessions come on. However, that’s none of my business, I am sent to nurse
you, and get you well; I do my duty with a safe conscience, it were well if
every body did the same.”
I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a
speech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt languid,
and unable to reflect on all that had passed. The whole series of my life
appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it were all true,
for it never presented itself to my mind with the force of reality.
As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew
feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed
me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me. The physician
came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared them for me;
but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the second. Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer, but the hangman who would gain his fee?
These were my first reflections; but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had
shewn me extreme kindness. He had caused the best room in the prison to
be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who had
provided a physician and a nurse. It is true, he seldom came to see me; for,
although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of every human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and miserable ravings of
a murderer. He came, therefore, sometimes to see that I was not neglected;
but his visits were short, and at long intervals.
150 FRANKENSTEIN
One day, when I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my
eyes half open, and my checks livid like those in death, I was overcome by
gloom and misery, and often reflected I had better seek death than remain
miserably pent up only to be let loose in a world replete with wretchedness.
At one time I considered whether I should not declare myself guilty, and
suffer the penalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been.
Such were my thoughts, when the door of my apartment was opened, and
Mr. Kirwin entered. His countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to mine, and addressed me in French—
“I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do any thing to
make you more comfortable?”
“I thank you; but all that you mention is nothing to me: on the whole
earth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.”
“I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to
one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune. But you will, I
hope, soon quit this melancholy abode; for, doubtless, evidence can easily
be brought to free you from the criminal charge.”
“That is my least concern: I am, by a course of strange events, become
the most miserable of mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I am and have
been, can death be any evil to me?”
“Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonizing than the
strange chances that have lately occurred. You were thrown, by some surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality, seized immediately, and charged with murder. The first sight that was presented to your
eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so unaccountable a manner,
and placed, as it were, by some fiend across your path.”
As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on
this retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at the
knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me. I suppose some astonishment was exhibited in my countenance; for Mr. Kirwin hastened to say—
“It was not until a day or two after your illness that I thought of examining your dress, that I might discover some trace by which I could send to
your relations an account of your misfortune and illness. I found several
letters, and, among others, one which I discovered from its commencement
to be from your father. I instantly wrote to Geneva: nearly two months
have elapsed since the departure of my letter.—But you are ill; even now
you tremble: you are unfit for agitation of any kind.”
“This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event:
tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am
now to lament.”
Volume III 151
“Your family is perfectly well,” said Mr. Kirwin, with gentleness; “and
some one, a friend, is come to visit you.”
I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it
instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my
misery, and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for me
to comply with his hellish desires. I put by hand before my eyes, and cried
out in agony—
“Oh! take him away! I cannot see him; for God’s sake, do not let him
enter!”
Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance. He could not
help regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt, and said, in
rather a severe tone—
“I should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father
would have been welcome, instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.”
“My father!” cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed
from anguish to pleasure. “Is my father, indeed, come? How kind, how very
kind. But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?”
My change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps
he thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium, and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence. He rose, and
quitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.
Nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than
the arrival of my father. I stretched out my hand to him, and cried—
“Are you then safe—and Elizabeth—and Ernest?”
My father calmed me with assurances of their welfare, and endeavoured, by dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise
my desponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode
of cheerfulness. “What a place is this that you inhabit, my son!” said he,
looking mournfully at the barred windows, and wretched appearance of
the room. “You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems to pursue
you. And poor Clerval—”
The name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too
great to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears.
“Alas! yes, my father,” replied I; “some destiny of the most horrible kind
hangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I should have died on
the coffin of Henry.”
We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the precarious
state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that could insure
tranquillity. Mr. Kirwin came in, and insisted that my strength should not
be exhausted by too much exertion. But the appearance of my father was to
me like that of my good angel, and I gradually recovered my health.
152 FRANKENSTEIN
As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black melancholy, that nothing could dissipate. The image of Clerval was for ever
before me, ghastly and murdered. More than once the agitation into which
these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous relapse.
Alas! why did they preserve so miserable and detested a life? It was surely
that I might fulfil my destiny, which is now drawing to a close. Soon, oh,
very soon, will death extinguish these throbbings, and relieve me from the
mighty weight of anguish that bears me to the dust; and, in executing the
award of justice, I shall also sink to rest. Then the appearance of death was
distant, although the wish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat
for hours motionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution
that might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.
The season of the assizes approached. I had already been three months
in prison; and although I was still weak, and in continual danger of a
relapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the county-town,
where the court was held. Mr. Kirwin charged himself with every care of
collecting witnesses, and arranging my defence. I was spared the disgrace
of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not brought before the
court that decides on life and death. The grand jury rejected the bill, on
its being proved that I was on the Orkney Islands at the hour the body
of my friend was found, and a fortnight after my removal I was liberated
from prison.
My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a
criminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh atmosphere,
and allowed to return to my native country. I did not participate in these
feelings; for to me the walls of a dungeon or a palace were alike hateful.
The cup of life was poisoned for ever;11 and although the sun shone upon me,
as upon the happy and gay of heart, I saw around me nothing but a dense
and frightful darkness, penetrated by no light but the glimmer of two eyes
that glared upon me. Sometimes they were the expressive eyes of Henry,
languishing in death, the dark orbs nearly covered by the lids, and the long
black lashes that fringed them; sometimes it was the watery clouded eyes
of the monster, as I first saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt.
11. Victor’s misery is all consuming, and it colors the way he sees his whole world, regardless of
his circumstances. As he states in this passage, to him “the walls of a dungeon or a palace were
alike hateful.” Such a perspective challenges the notion that there is an objective reality “out there,”
considering that Victor’s reality—his “cup of life”—is so significantly shaped by his personal
misery and grief.

Volume III 153
My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection. He talked of
Geneva, which I should soon visit—of Elizabeth, and Ernest; but these
words only drew deep groans from me. Sometimes, indeed, I felt a wish for
happiness; and thought, with melancholy delight, of my beloved cousin; or
longed, with a devouring maladie du pays, to see once more the blue lake
and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early childhood: but my
general state of feeling was a torpor, in which a prison was as welcome
a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and these fits were seldom
interrupted, but by paroxysms of anguish and despair. At these moments I
often endeavoured to put an end to the existence I loathed; and it required
unceasing attendance and vigilance to restrain me from committing some
dreadful act of violence.
I remember, as I quitted the prison, I heard one of the men say, “He may
be innocent of the murder, but he has certainly a bad conscience.” These
words struck me. A bad conscience! yes, surely I had one. William, Justine, and Clerval, had died through my infernal machinations; “And whose
death,” cried I, “is to finish the tragedy? Ah! my father, do not remain in
this wretched country; take me where I may forget myself, my existence,
and all the world.”
My father easily acceded to my desire; and, after having taken leave of
Mr. Kirwin, we hastened to Dublin. I felt as if I was relieved from a heavy
weight, when the packet sailed with a fair wind from Ireland, and I had quitted for ever the country which had been to me the scene of so much misery.
It was midnight. My father slept in the cabin; and I lay on the deck,
looking at the stars, and listening to the dashing of the waves. I hailed the
darkness that shut Ireland from my sight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy, when I reflected that I should soon see Geneva. The past appeared
to me in the light of a frightful dream; yet the vessel in which I was, the
wind that blew me from the detested shore of Ireland, and the sea which
surrounded me, told me too forcibly that I was deceived by no vision, and
that Clerval, my friend and dearest companion, had fallen a victim to me
and the monster of my creation. I repassed, in my memory, my whole life;
my quiet happiness while residing with my family in Geneva, the death
of my mother, and my departure for Ingolstadt. I remembered shuddering
at the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on to the creation of my hideous
enemy, and I called to mind the night during which he first lived. I was
unable to pursue the train of thought; a thousand feelings pressed upon
me, and I wept bitterly.
Ever since my recovery from the fever I had been in the custom of taking every night a small quantity of laudanum; for it was by means of this 
154 FRANKENSTEIN
drug only that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of life. Oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I now
took a double dose, and soon slept profoundly. But sleep did not afford me
respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a thousand objects
that scared me. Towards morning I was possessed by a kind of night-mare;
I felt the fiend’s grasp in my neck, and could not free myself from it; groans
and cries rung in my ears. My father, who was watching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me, and pointed to the port of Holyhead, which
we were now entering.
CHAPTER V.
We had resolved not to go to London, but to cross the country to Portsmouth,
and thence to embark for Havre. I preferred this plan principally because
I dreaded to see again those places in which I had enjoyed a few moments
of tranquillity with my beloved Clerval. I thought with horror of seeing
again those persons whom we had been accustomed to visit together, and
who might make inquiries concerning an event, the very remembrance of
which made me again feel the pang I endured when I gazed on his lifeless
form in the inn at ———.
As for my father, his desires and exertions were bounded to the again
seeing me restored to health and peace of mind. His tenderness and attentions were unremitting; my grief and gloom was obstinate, but he would
not despair. Sometimes he thought that I felt deeply the degradation of
being obliged to answer a charge of murder, and he endeavoured to prove
to me the futility of pride.
“Alas! my father,” said I, “how little do you know me. Human beings,
their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded, if such a wretch
as I felt pride. Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent as I, and
she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause of this—I
murdered her. William, Justine, and Henry—they all died by my hands.”
My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the
same assertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to
desire an explanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as caused
by delirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented itself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved
in my convalescence. I avoided explanation, and maintained a continual
silence concerning the wretch I had created. I had a feeling that I should
be supposed mad, and this for ever chained my tongue, when I would have
given the whole world to have confided the fatal secret.
Volume III 155
Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded
wonder, “What do you mean, Victor? are you mad? My dear son, I entreat
you never to make such an assertion again.”
“I am not mad,” I cried energetically; “the sun and the heavens, who
have viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth. I am the assassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations. A thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have saved
their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not sacrifice the whole
human race.”
The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were
deranged, and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation, and
endeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts. He wished as much as possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in Ireland,
and never alluded to them, or suffered me to speak of my misfortunes.
As time passed away I became more calm: misery had her dwelling in
my heart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own
crimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them. By the utmost selfviolence, I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which sometimes
desired to declare itself to the whole world; and my manners were calmer
and more composed than they had ever been since my journey to the sea
of ice.
We arrived at Havre on the 8th of May, and instantly proceeded to
Paris, where my father had some business which detained us a few weeks.
In this city, I received the following letter from Elizabeth:—
“ To VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN.
“MY DEAREST FRIEND,
“It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle dated at
Paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and I may hope to see you
in less than a fortnight. My poor cousin, how much you must have suffered!
I expect to see you looking even more ill than when you quitted Geneva.
This winter has been passed most miserably, tortured as I have been by
anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in your countenance, and to find
that your heart is not totally devoid of comfort and tranquillity.
“Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable
a year ago, even perhaps augmented by time. I would not disturb you at
this period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you; but a conversation
that I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders some explanation necessary before we meet.
156 FRANKENSTEIN
“Explanation! you may possibly say; what can Elizabeth have to explain?
If you really say this, my questions are answered, and I have no more to
do than to sign myself your affectionate cousin. But you are distant from
me, and it is possible that you may dread, and yet be pleased with this
explanation; and, in a probability of this being the case, I dare not any
longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I have often wished to
express to you, but have never had the courage to begin.
“You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of
your parents ever since our infancy. We were told this when young, and
taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take place.
We were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I believe, dear and
valued friends to one another as we grew older. But as brother and sister
often entertain a lively affection towards each other, without desiring a
more intimate union, may not such also be our case? Tell me, dearest Victor.
Answer me, I conjure you, by our mutual happiness, with simple truth—Do
you not love another?
“You have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at Ingolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you last autumn so
unhappy, flying to solitude, from the society of every creature, I could not
help supposing that you might regret our connexion, and believe yourself
bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of your parents, although they opposed
themselves to your inclinations. But this is false reasoning. I confess to
you, my cousin, that I love you, and that in my airy dreams of futurity you
have been my constant friend and companion. But it is your happiness I
desire as well as my own, when I declare to you, that our marriage would
render me eternally miserable, unless it were the dictate of your own free
choice. Even now I weep to think, that, borne down as you are by the cruelest misfortunes, you may stifle, by the word honour, all hope of that love
and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself. I, who have so
interested an affection for you, may increase your miseries ten-fold, by being
an obstacle to your wishes. Ah, Victor, be assured that your cousin and
playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be made miserable by this
supposition. Be happy, my friend; and if you obey me in this one request,
remain satisfied that nothing on earth will have the power to interrupt my
tranquillity.
“Do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer it to-morrow, or the
next day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain. My uncle will
send me news of your health; and if I see but one smile on your lips when
we meet, occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, I shall need no
other happiness.
Volume III 157
“ELIZABETH LAVENZA.
“Geneva, May 18th, 17—.”
This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat
of the fiend—“I will be with you on your wedding-night!” Such was my
sentence, and on that night would the dæmon employ every art to destroy
me, and tear me from the glimpse of happiness which promised partly to
console my sufferings. On that night he had determined to consummate
his crimes by my death. Well, be it so; a deadly struggle would then assuredly take place, in which if he was victorious, I should be at peace, and his
power over me be at an end. If he were vanquished, I should be a free man.
Alas! what freedom? such as the peasant enjoys when his family have been
massacred before his eyes, his cottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is
turned adrift, homeless, pennyless, and alone, but free. Such would be my
liberty, except that in my Elizabeth I possessed a treasure; alas! balanced
by those horrors of remorse and guilt, which would pursue me until death.
Sweet and beloved Elizabeth! I read and re-read her letter, and some
softened feelings stole into my heart, and dared to whisper paradisaical
dreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the angel’s
arm bared to drive me from all hope. Yet I would die to make her happy. If
the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet, again, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate. My destruction might
indeed arrive a few months sooner; but if my torturer should suspect that
I postponed it, influenced by his menaces, he would surely find other, and
perhaps more dreadful means of revenge. He had vowed to be with me on
my wedding-night, yet he did not consider that threat as binding him to
peace in the mean time; for, as if to shew me that he was not yet satiated
with blood, he had murdered Clerval immediately after the enunciation
of his threats. I resolved, therefore, that if my immediate union with my
cousin would conduce either to her’s or my father’s happiness, my adversary’s designs against my life should not retard it a single hour.12
12. Altruism, typically conceived of as selfless concern for the best interest of others, is usually
seen as a positive quality. Though Victor does appear altruistic here, he never shows selfless
concern for his creation and instead shirks responsibility for the creature and his well-being.
Moreover, in the context of scientific research, it is important to consider the tireless or “altruistic”
behavior of the researcher that leads to the complete abnegation of the self, resulting in unreflective decisions and actions. Perhaps if Victor had taken the time to reflect on himself—his motives,
decisions, desires, and actions—during his scientific pursuits, he would have refrained from
bringing his creature to life in the first place.
Nicole Piemonte.
158 FRANKENSTEIN
In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth. My letter was calm and affectionate. “I fear, my beloved girl,” I said, “little happiness remains for us on
earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy is concentered in you. Chase away
your idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate my life, and my endeavours for
contentment. I have one secret, Elizabeth, a dreadful one; when revealed to
you, it will chill your frame with horror, and then, far from being surprised
at my misery, you will only wonder that I survive what I have endured. I
will confide this tale of misery and terror to you the day after our marriage
shall take place; for, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence
between us. But until then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it.
This I most earnestly entreat, and I know you will comply.”
In about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth’s letter, we returned to
Geneva. My cousin welcomed me with warm affection; yet tears were in her
eyes, as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. I saw a change
in her also. She was thinner, and had lost much of that heavenly vivacity
that had before charmed me; but her gentleness, and soft looks of compassion, made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as I was.
The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure. Memory brought
madness with it; and when I thought on what had passed, a real insanity
possessed me; sometimes I was furious, and burnt with rage, sometimes
low and despondent. I neither spoke nor looked, but sat motionless, bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me.
Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle
voice would soothe me when transported by passion, and inspire me with
human feelings when sunk in torpor. She wept with me, and for me. When
reason returned, she would remonstrate, and endeavour to inspire me with
resignation. Ah! it is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for the
guilty there is no peace. The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is
otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief.
Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with
my cousin. I remained silent.
“Have you, then, some other attachment?”
“None on earth. I love Elizabeth, and look forward to our union with
delight. Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate myself, in
life or death, to the happiness of my cousin.”
“My dear Victor, do not speak thus. Heavy misfortunes have befallen
us; but let us only cling closer to what remains, and transfer our love for
those whom we have lost to those who yet live. Our circle will be small, but
bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune. And when time
shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of care will be born
to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly deprived.”
Volume III 159
Such were the lessons of my father. But to me the remembrance of the
threat returned: nor can you wonder, that, omnipotent as the fiend had
yet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as invincible;
and that when he had pronounced the words, “I shall be with you on your
wedding-night,” I should regard the threatened fate as unavoidable. But
death was no evil to me, if the loss of Elizabeth were balanced with it; and
I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful countenance, agreed with
my father, that if my cousin would consent, the ceremony should take place
in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined, the seal to my fate.
Great God! if for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish
intention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myself
for ever from my native country, and wandered a friendless outcast over
the earth, than have consented to this miserable marriage. But, as if possessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real intentions;
and when I thought that I prepared only my own death, I hastened that of
a far dearer victim.
As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me. But I concealed
my feelings by an appearance of hilarity, that brought smiles and joy to the
countenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer
eye of Elizabeth. She looked forward to our union with placid contentment,
not unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed,
that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness, might soon dissipate into an airy dream, and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret.
Preparations were made for the event; congratulatory visits were
received; and all wore a smiling appearance. I shut up, as well as I could,
in my own heart the anxiety that preyed there, and entered with seeming
earnestness into the plans of my father, although they might only serve as
the decorations of my tragedy. A house was purchased for us near Cologny,
by which we should enjoy the pleasures of the country, and yet be so near
Geneva as to see my father every day; who would still reside within the walls,
for the benefit of Ernest, that he might follow his studies at the schools.
ln the mean time I took every precaution to defend my person, in case
the fiend should openly attack me. I carried pistols and a dagger constantly about me, and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice; and by
these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity. Indeed, as the period
approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be regarded as
worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty, as the day fixed for its solemnization drew nearer, and I heard it continually spoken of as an occurrence
which no accident could possibly prevent.
160 FRANKENSTEIN
Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly
to calm her mind. But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my
destiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her; and
perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret, which I had promised to
reveal to her the following day. My father was in the mean time overjoyed,
and, in the bustle of preparation, only observed in the melancholy of his
niece the diffidence of a bride.
After the ceremony was performed, a large party assembled at my
father’s; but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should pass the afternoon
and night at Evian, and return to Cologny the next morning. As the day
was fair, and the wind favourable, we resolved to go by water.
Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the feeling of happiness. We passed rapidly along: the sun was hot, but we were
sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy, while we enjoyed the beauty of
the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw Mont Salêve,
the pleasant banks of Montalêgre, and at a distance, surmounting all, the
beautiful Mont Blanc, and the assemblage of snowy mountains that in vain
endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the opposite banks, we saw
the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the ambition that would quit its
native country, and an almost insurmountable barrier to the invader who
should wish to enslave it.
I took the hand of Elizabeth: “You are sorrowful, my love. Ah! if you
knew what I have suffered, and what I may yet endure, you would endeavour to let me taste the quiet, and freedom from despair, that this one day
at least permits me to enjoy.”
“Be happy, my dear Victor,” replied Elizabeth; “there is, I hope, nothing
to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not painted in my face,
my heart is contented. Something whispers to me not to depend too much
on the prospect that is opened before us; but I will not listen to such a sinister voice. Observe how fast we move along, and how the clouds which sometimes obscure, and sometimes rise above the dome of Mont Blanc, render
this scene of beauty still more interesting. Look also at the innumerable
fish that are swimming in the clear waters, where we can distinguish every
pebble that lies at the bottom. What a divine day! how happy and serene
all nature appears!”
Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all
reflection upon melancholy subjects. But her temper was fluctuating; joy
for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place to distraction and reverie.
Volume III 161
The sun sunk lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance, and
observed its path through the chasms of the higher, and the glens of the
lower hills. The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached the
amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary. The spire of
Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it, and the range of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.
The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity,
sunk at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water, and
caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the shore,
from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and hay. The sun
sunk beneath the horizon as we landed; and as I touched the shore, I felt
those cares and fears revive, which soon were to clasp me, and cling to me
for ever.
CHAPTER VI.
It was eight o’clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the
shore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn, and contemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured in
darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines.
The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence
in the west. The moon had reached her summit in the heavens, and was
beginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the flight of
the vulture, and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the scene of the
busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves that were beginning to rise. Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended.
I had been calm during the day; but so soon as night obscured the
shapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind. I was anxious and
watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in my
bosom; every sound terrified me; but I resolved that I would sell my life
dearly, and not relax the impending conflict until my own life, or that of my
adversary, were extinguished.
Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful
silence; at length she said, “What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor?
What is it you fear?”
“Oh! peace, peace, my love,” replied I, “this night, and all will be safe:
but this night is dreadful, very dreadful.”
I passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how
dreadful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife, 
162 FRANKENSTEIN
and I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her until I had
obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy.
She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the
passages of the house, and inspecting every corner that might afford a
retreat to my adversary. But I discovered no trace of him, and was beginning to conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent
the execution of his menaces; when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful
scream. It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired. As I heard
it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the motion of
every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood trickling in
my veins, and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. This state lasted but
for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed into the room.
Great God! why did I not then expire! Why am I here to relate the
destruction of the best hope, and the purest creature of earth? She was
there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging
down, and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair. Every
where I turn I see the same figure—her bloodless arms and relaxed form
flung by the murderer on its bridal bier. Could I behold this, and live? Alas!
life is obstinate, and clings closest where it is most hated. For a moment
only did I lose recollection; I fainted.
When I recovered, I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn;
their countenances expressed a breathless terror: but the horror of others
appeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me. I
escaped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love,
my wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy. She had been moved from the
posture in which I had first beheld her; and now, as she lay, her head upon
her arm, and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have
supposed her asleep. I rushed towards her, and embraced her with ardour;
but the deathly languor and coldness of the limbs told me, that what I now
held in my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and
cherished. The murderous mark of the fiend’s grasp was on her neck, and
the breath had ceased to issue from her lips.
While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look
up. The windows of the room had before been darkened; and I felt a kind
of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber. The shutters had been thrown back; and, with a sensation of horror
not to be described, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous
and abhorred. A grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as
with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. I rushed
towards the window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, shot; but he 
Volume III 163
eluded me, leaped from his station, and, running with the swiftness of lightning, plunged into the lake.
The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I pointed to the
spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with boats; nets
were cast, but in vain. After passing several hours, we returned hopeless,
most of my companions believing it to have been a form conjured by my
fancy. After having landed, they proceeded to search the country, parties
going in different directions among the woods and vines.
I did not accompany them; I was exhausted: a film covered my eyes,
and my skin was parched with the heat of fever. In this state I lay on a bed,
hardly conscious of what had happened; my eyes wandered round the room,
as if to seek something that I had lost.
At length I remembered that my father would anxiously expect the
return of Elizabeth and myself, and that I must return alone. This reflection brought tears into my eyes, and I wept for a long time; but my thoughts
rambled to various subjects, reflecting on my misfortunes, and their cause.
I was bewildered in a cloud of wonder and horror. The death of William,
the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly of my wife; even
at that moment I knew not that my only remaining friends were safe from
the malignity of the fiend; my father even now might be writhing under his
grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his feet. This idea made me shudder,
and recalled me to action. I started up, and resolved to return to Geneva
with all possible speed.
There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake;
but the wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents. However, it
was hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night. I
hired men to row, and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced
relief from mental torment in bodily exercise.13 But the overflowing misery
I now felt, and the excess of agitation that I endured, rendered me incapable of any exertion. I threw down the oar; and, leaning my head upon
my hands, gave way to every gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up, I saw
the scenes which were familiar to me in my happier time, and which I had
13. After the deaths of his brother, his friend, and his bride, Victor seeks refuge from his grief in
strenuous exercise, just as he walked the streets of Ingolstadt after creating the creature. Influential thinkers of the Enlightenment vigorously pursued theories about the relationship between
the mind and the body and about the place that exercise holds in physical and mental health. René
Descartes, the seventeenth-century French scientific philosopher, promulgated the idea that
humans have a dual nature—a material body and a nonmaterial mind—and that although they are
separate, each can influence the other via the pineal gland. Joseph Addison (1672–1718), an influential thinker and essayist of the early eighteenth century, held a broad view about the means by 
164 FRANKENSTEIN
contemplated but the day before in the company of her who was now but
a shadow and a recollection. Tears streamed from my eyes. The rain had
ceased for a moment, and I saw the fish play in the waters as they had
done a few hours before; they had then been observed by Elizabeth. Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change. The
sun might shine, or the clouds might lour; but nothing could appear to me
as it had done the day before. A fiend had snatched from me every hope
of future happiness: no creature had ever been so miserable as I was; so
frightful an event is single in the history of man.
But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming event. Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their
acme, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you. Know that,
one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate. My own
strength is exhausted; and I must tell, in a few words, what remains of my
hideous narration.
I arrived at Geneva. My father and Ernest yet lived; but the former
sunk under the tidings that I bore. I see him now, excellent and venerable
old man! his eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and
their delight—his niece, his more than daughter, whom he doated on with
all that affection which a man feels, who, in the decline of life, having few
affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain. Cursed, cursed be
the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs, and doomed him to waste
in wretchedness! He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated around him; an apoplectic fit was brought on, and in a few days he
died in my arms.
What then became of me? I know not; I lost sensation, and chains
and darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me. Sometimes,
indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales
with the friends of my youth; but awoke, and found myself in a dungeon.
which the body could influence the mind and wrote extensively on the usefulness of exercise in
avoiding “melancholic spleen” in men and “the vapours” in women. “Whatever we do,” Addison
wrote, “we should keep up the cheerfulness of our spirits and never let them sink below an
inclination at least to be well-pleased. The way of this is to keep our bodies in exercise, our minds
at ease” (1711). Victor Frankenstein, in exercising to alleviate his mental anguish, has taken to
heart Addison’s advice from a century earlier. Present-day neuroscientists likewise theorize that
vigorous exercise stimulates the pituitary gland to release endorphins, substances that can
alleviate pain and induce euphoria, the well-known “runner’s high,” and have found evidence that
regular physical activity reduces anxiety and depression (see Anderson and Shivakumar 2013;
Batchelder 2012; Leuenberger 2006).

Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear conception of my miseries and situation, and was then released from my prison. For they had
called me mad; and during many months, as I understood, a solitary cell
had been my habitation.
But liberty had been a useless gift to me had I not, as I awakened to
reason, at the same time awakened to revenge. As the memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their cause—the monster
whom I had created, the miserable dæmon whom I had sent abroad into
the world for my destruction. I was possessed by a maddening rage when
I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed that I might have him
within my grasp to wreak a great and signal revenge on his cursed head.
Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to reflect
on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about a month
after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town, and told him
that I had an accusation to make; that I knew the destroyer of my family;
and that I required him to exert his whole authority for the apprehension
of the murderer.
The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness: “Be assured,
sir,” said he, “no pains or exertions on my part shall be spared to discover
the villain.”
“I thank you,” replied I; “listen, therefore, to the deposition that I have
to make. It is indeed a tale so strange, that I should fear you would not
credit it, were there not something in truth which, however wonderful,
forces conviction. The story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream,
and I have no motive for falsehood.” My manner, as I thus addressed him,
was impressive, but calm; I had formed in my own heart a resolution to
pursue my destroyer to death; and this purpose quieted my agony, and
provisionally reconciled me to life. I now related my history briefly, but
with firmness and precision, marking the dates with accuracy, and never
deviating into invective or exclamation.
The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued he became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with horror, at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was
painted on his countenance.
When I had concluded my narration, I said, “This is the being whom I
accuse, and for whose detection and punishment I call upon you to exert
your whole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope
that your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those functions on this occasion.”
166 FRANKENSTEIN
This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my
auditor. He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given
to a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon
to act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity returned.
He, however, answered mildly, “I would willingly afford you every aid in
your pursuit; but the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. Who can follow an animal
which can traverse the sea of ice, and inhabit caves and dens, where no
man would venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since
the commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he
has wandered, or what region he may now inhabit.”
“I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit; and if he
has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois,
and destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive your thoughts: you do not
credit my narrative, and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his desert.”
As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated;
“You are mistaken,” said he, “I will exert myself; and if it is in my power to
seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his crimes. But I fear, from what you have yourself described to be
his properties, that this will prove impracticable, and that, while every
proper measure is pursued, you should endeavour to make up your mind
to disappointment.”
“That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail. My revenge
is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I confess that it is
the devouring and only passion of my soul. My rage is unspeakable, when
I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned loose upon society, still
exists. You refuse my just demand: I have but one resource; and I devote
myself, either in my life or death, to his destruction.”14
14. Retribution is punishment for an injury, wrongdoing, or crime. In organized societies, the law
imposes retribution in the form of penalties such as imprisonment. In the absence or failure of
law, individuals may seek to impose retribution in the wild, unrestrained form of revenge—one of
this novel’s major themes. The creature, abandoned by his creator and rejected by the family he
hoped to befriend, furiously vows “eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind” (p. 118). His desire
for vengeance ultimately zeroes in on Victor’s loved ones, and so he destroys William, Justine,
Clerval, and Elizabeth in turn. After Elizabeth’s death, Victor significantly first seeks retribution
through law, urging a judge to bring the creature to justice. When the judge explains his powerlessness to help in the pursuit—that is, when society fails Victor—he becomes a mirror of the creature
in his obsession with vengeance. As a consequence, Victor loses both the rationality of the scientist
and the normal connections and affections of a civilized person. His search for the creature eventually leads him to the icy region of the North Pole—a journey symbolizing the freezing out of human 
Volume III 167
I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a phrenzy in
my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness, which
the martyrs of old are said to have possessed. But to a Genevan magistrate,
whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of devotion and
heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of madness. He
endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child, and reverted to my tale
as the effects of delirium.
“Man,” I cried, “how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom! Cease;
you know not what it is you say.”15
I broke from the house angry and disturbed, and retired to meditate on
some other mode of action.
CHAPTER VII.
My present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was swallowed up and lost. I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone endowed me
with strength and composure; it modelled my feelings, and allowed me
to be calculating and calm, at periods when otherwise delirium or death
would have been my portion.
My first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever; my country, which,
when I was happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity,
became hateful. I provided myself with a sum of money, together with a
few jewels which had belonged to my mother, and departed.
And now my wanderings began, which are to cease but with life. I have
traversed a vast portion of the earth, and have endured all the hardships
which travellers, in deserts and barbarous countries, are wont to meet.
How I have lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing
limbs upon the sandy plain, and prayed for death. But revenge kept me
alive; I dared not die, and leave my adversary in being.
feeling that comes with the blind pursuit of vengeance. The destructive nature of such a pursuit
has been a theme of literature since the time of the ancient Greeks. Here Mary adds the troubling
notion that science itself—however based in rationality and a drive for human progress—may
inadvertently create disruptions that unleash the most irrational and violent of human feelings,
which override the ability of society’s institutions to contain them.
Mike Stanford.
15. Victor’s objection here is that the Genevan magistrate is being arrogant in assuming a position
of understanding that he (the magistrate) feels is necessary to dispense absolution. The moment
foreshadows the anxiety of contemporary citizens who feel that they simply don’t know enough to
engage in discussions of scientific morality.

168 FRANKENSTEIN
When I quitted Geneva, my first labour was to gain some clue by which
I might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy. But my plan was unsettled;
and I wandered many hours around the confines of the town, uncertain
what path I should pursue. As night approached, I found myself at the
entrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father, reposed.
I entered it, and approached the tomb which marked their graves. Every
thing was silent, except the leaves of the trees, which were gently agitated
by the wind; the night was nearly dark; and the scene would have been
solemn and affecting even to an uninterested observer. The spirits of the
departed seemed to flit around, and to cast a shadow, which was felt but
seen not, around the head of the mourner.
The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way
to rage and despair. They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived,
and to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence. I knelt on the
grass, and kissed the earth, and with quivering lips exclaimed, “By the
sacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the
deep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and by the
spirits that preside over thee, I swear to pursue the dæmon, who caused
this misery, until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict. For this purpose
I will preserve my life: to execute this dear revenge, will I again behold
the sun, and tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should
vanish from my eyes for ever. And I call on you, spirits of the dead; and on
you, wandering ministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work.
Let the cursed and hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the
despair that now torments me.”
I had begun my adjuration with solemnity, and an awe which almost
assured me that the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved
my devotion; but the furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choaked
my utterance.
I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish
laugh. It rung on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed it, and
I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter. Surely in that
moment I should have been possessed by phrenzy, and have destroyed my
miserable existence, but that my vow was heard, and that I was reserved
for vengeance. The laughter died away; when a well-known and abhorred
voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an audible whisper—
“I am satisfied: miserable wretch! you have determined to live, and I am
satisfied.”
I darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded; but the
devil eluded my grasp. Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose, and 
Volume III 169
shone full upon his ghastly and distorted shape, as he fled with more than
mortal speed.
I pursued him; and for many months this has been my task. Guided
by a slight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly. The blue
Mediterranean appeared; and, by a strange chance, I saw the fiend enter
by night, and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea. I took my
passage in the same ship; but he escaped, I know not how.
Amid the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I
have ever followed in his track. Sometimes the peasants, scared by this
horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself, who
feared that if I lost all trace I should despair and die, often left some mark
to guide me. The snows descended on my head, and I saw the print of his
huge step on the white plain. To you first entering on life, to whom care
is new, and agony unknown, how can you understand what I have felt, and
still feel? Cold, want, and fatigue, were the least pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil, and carried about with me
my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good followed and directed my steps,
and, when I most murmured, would suddenly extricate me from seemingly
insurmountable difficulties. Sometimes, when nature, overcome by hunger,
sunk under the exhaustion, a repast was prepared for me in the desert,
that restored and inspirited me. The fare was indeed coarse, such as the
peasants of the country ate; but I may not doubt that it was set there by
the spirits that I had invoked to aid me. Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the
sky, shed the few drops that revived me, and vanish.16
I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the dæmon
generally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the country
chiefly collected. In other places human beings were seldom seen; and I
generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my path. I had money
with me, and gained the friendship of the villagers by distributing it, or
bringing with me some food that I had killed, which, after taking a small
part, I always presented to those who had provided me with fire and utensils for cooking.
16. Most people attribute their successes to their own efforts. People pride themselves on great
preparation and stellar execution. Most, however, do not recognize how often their success is a
result of the world lining up in exactly the right way so that this effort and preparation can pay off.
When you look back on your life, though, you may recognize that luck and happenstance led to
your successes. In this passage, Victor reflects on the role that chance and serendipity have played
in his successes. Just when things look darkest, circumstances align to allow him to continue his
pursuit of the creature.

My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during
sleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! often, when most miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The spirits
that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of happiness, that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage. Deprived of this
respite, I should have sunk under my hardships. During the day I was sustained and inspirited by the hope of night: for in sleep I saw my friends, my
wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolent countenance of
my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth’s voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth. Often, when wearied by a toilsome march,
I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should come, and that
I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest friends. What agonizing fondness did I feel for them! how did I cling to their dear forms, as
sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and persuade myself that
they still lived! At such moments vengeance, that burned within me, died
in my heart, and I pursued my path towards the destruction of the dæmon,
more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the mechanical impulse of some
power of which I was unconscious, than as the ardent desire of my soul.
What his feelings were whom I pursued, I cannot know. Sometimes,
indeed, he left marks in writing on the barks of the trees, or cut in stone,
that guided me, and instigated my fury. “My reign is not yet over,” (these
words were legible in one of these inscriptions); “you live, and my power
is complete. Follow me; I seek the everlasting ices of the north, where you
will feel the misery of cold and frost, to which I am impassive. You will
find near this place, if you follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat, and be
refreshed. Come on, my enemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives; but
many hard and miserable hours must you endure, until that period shall
arrive.”
Scoffing devil! Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee, miserable fiend, to torture and death. Never will I omit my search, until he or
I perish; and then with what ecstacy shall I join my Elizabeth, and those
who even now prepare for me the reward of my tedious toil and horrible
pilgrimage.
As I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened,
and the cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support. The peasants were shut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured
forth to seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hidingplaces to seek for prey. The rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could
be procured; and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.
Volume III 171
The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours.
One inscription that he left was in these words: “Prepare! your toils only
begin: wrap yourself in furs, and provide food, for we shall soon enter upon
a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting hatred.”
My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words;
I resolved not to fail in my purpose; and, calling on heaven to support
me, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts, until
the ocean appeared at a distance, and formed the utmost boundary of the
horizon. Oh! how unlike it was to the blue seas of the south! Covered with
ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by its superior wildness and
ruggedness. The Greeks wept for joy when they beheld the Mediterranean
from the hills of Asia, and hailed with rapture the boundary of their toils. I
did not weep; but I knelt down, and, with a full heart, thanked my guiding
spirit for conducting me in safety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversary’s gibe, to meet and grapple with him.
Some weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs, and
thus traversed the snows with inconceivable speed. I know not whether
the fiend possessed the same advantages; but I found that, as before I had
daily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him; so much so, that
when I first saw the ocean, he was but one day’s journey in advance, and
I hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach. With new courage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched hamlet
on the sea-shore. I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the fiend, and
gained accurate information. A gigantic monster, they said, had arrived
the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols; putting to flight the
inhabitants of a solitary cottage, through fear of his terrific appearance.
He had carried off their store of winter food, and, placing it in a sledge, to
draw which he had seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same night, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers,
had pursued his journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land;
and they conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking
of the ice, or frozen by the eternal frosts.
On hearing this information, I suffered a temporary access of despair.
He had escaped me; and I must commence a destructive and almost endless journey across the mountainous ices of the ocean,—amidst cold that
few of the inhabitants could long endure, and which I, the native of a genial
and sunny climate, could not hope to survive. Yet at the idea that the fiend
should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance returned, and, like
a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling. After a slight repose, during 
172 FRANKENSTEIN
which the spirits of the dead hovered round, and instigated me to toil and
revenge, I prepared for my journey.
I exchanged my land sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of the
frozen ocean; and, purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I departed
from land.
I cannot guess how many days have passed since then; but I have
endured misery, which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution burning within my heart could have enabled me to support. Immense
and rugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heard
the thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction. But again
the frost came, and made the paths of the sea secure.
By the quantity of provision which I had consumed I should guess that
I had passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction of
hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of despondency and grief from my eyes. Despair had indeed almost secured her prey,
and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery; when once, after the
poor animals that carried me had with incredible toil gained the summit
of a sloping ice mountain, and one sinking under his fatigue died, I viewed
the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye caught a dark
speck upon the dusky plain. I strained my sight to discover what it could
be, and uttered a wild cry of ecstacy when I distinguished a sledge, and
the distorted proportions of a well-known form within. Oh! with what a
burning gush did hope revisit my heart! warm tears filled my eyes, which
I hastily wiped away, that they might not intercept the view I had of the
dæmon; but still my sight was dimmed by the burning drops, until, giving
way to the emotions that oppressed me, I wept aloud.
But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their
dead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food; and, after an hour’s
rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly irksome
to me, I continued my route. The sledge was still visible; nor did I again
lose sight of it, except at the moments when for a short time some ice rock
concealed it with its intervening crags. I indeed perceptibly gained on it;
and when, after nearly two days’ journey, I beheld my enemy at no more
than a mile distant, my heart bounded within me.
But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my enemy, my hopes
were suddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than
I had ever done before. A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, as the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment
more ominous and terrific. I pressed on, but in vain. The wind arose; the
sea roared; and, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split, and 
Volume III 173
cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound. The work was soon
finished: in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my
enemy, and I was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice, that was continually lessening, and thus preparing for me a hideous death.
In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died;
and I myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress, when I
saw your vessel riding at anchor, and holding forth to me hopes of succour
and life. I had no conception that vessels ever came so far north, and was
astounded at the sight. I quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct
oars, and by these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my
ice-raft in the direction of your ship. I had determined, if you were going
southward, still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas, rather than abandon my purpose. I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I
could still pursue my enemy. But your direction was northward. You took
me on board when my vigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk
under my multiplied hardships into a death, which I still dread,—for my
task is unfulfilled.
Oh! when will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the dæmon, allow
me the rest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet live? If I do, swear
to me, Walton, that he shall not escape; that you will seek him, and satisfy
my vengeance in his death. Yet, do I dare ask you to undertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that I have undergone? No; I am not so selfish. Yet, when I am dead, if he should appear; if the ministers of vengeance
should conduct him to you, swear that he shall not live—swear that he
shall not triumph over my accumulated woes, and live to make another
such a wretch as I am. He is eloquent and persuasive; and once his words
had even power over my heart: but trust him not. His soul is as hellish
as his form, full of treachery and fiend-like malice. Hear him not; call on
the manes17 of William, Justine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and of the
wretched Victor, and thrust your sword into his heart. I will hover near,
and direct the steel aright.

deceased.

WALTON, IN CONTINUATION.
August 26th, 17—.
You have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and do you not feel
your blood congealed with horror, like that which even now curdles mine?
Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his tale; at
others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with difficulty the words
so replete with agony. His fine and lovely eyes were now lighted up with
indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow, and quenched in infinite
wretchedness. Sometimes he commanded his countenance and tones, and
related the most horrible incidents with a tranquil voice, suppressing
every mark of agitation; then, like a volcano bursting forth, his face would
suddenly change to an expression of the wildest rage, as he shrieked out
imprecations on his persecutor.
His tale is connected, and told with an appearance of the simplest
truth; yet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he shewed
me, and the apparition of the monster, seen from our ship, brought to me
a greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations,
however earnest and connected. Such a monster has then really existence;
I cannot doubt it; yet I am lost in surprise and admiration. Sometimes I
endeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of his creature’s
formation; but on this point he was impenetrable.
“Are you mad, my friend?” said he, “or whither does your senseless
curiosity lead you? Would you also create for yourself and the world a
demoniacal enemy? Or to what do your questions tend? Peace, peace! learn
my miseries, and do not seek to increase your own.”
Frankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history: he
asked to see them, and then himself corrected and augmented them in
many places; but principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held with his enemy. “Since you have preserved my narration,”
said he, “I would not that a mutilated one should go down to posterity.”
Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest
tale that ever imagination formed. My thoughts, and every feeling of my
soul, have been drunk up by the interest for my guest, which this tale,
and his own elevated and gentle manners have created. I wish to soothe
him; yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of every
hope of consolation, to live? Oh, no! the only joy that he can now know will
be when he composes his shattered feelings to peace and death. Yet he
enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and delirium: he believes, that,
when in dreams he holds converse with his friends, and derives from that 
Volume III 175
communion consolation for his miseries, or excitements to his vengeance,
that they are not the creations of his fancy, but the real beings who visit
him from the regions of a remote world. This faith gives a solemnity to his
reveries that render them to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth.
Our conversations are not always confined to his own history and
misfortunes. On every point of general literature he displays unbounded
knowledge, and a quick and piercing apprehension. His eloquence is forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when he relates a pathetic incident,
or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love, without tears. What a
glorious creature must he have been in the days of his prosperity, when he
is thus noble and godlike in ruin. He seems to feel his own worth, and the
greatness of his fall.
“When younger,” said he, “I felt as if I were destined for some great enterprise. My feelings are profound; but I possessed a coolness of judgment
that fitted me for illustrious achievements. This sentiment of the worth
of my nature supported me, when others would have been oppressed; for I
deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that might
be useful to my fellow-creatures. When I reflected on the work I had completed, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational animal,
I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors. But this feeling, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now serves
only to plunge me lower in the dust. All my speculations and hopes are as
nothing; and, like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am chained
in an eternal hell. My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of analysis
and application were intense; by the union of these qualities I conceived
the idea, and executed the creation of a man.18 Even now I cannot recollect, without passion, my reveries while the work was incomplete. I trod
heaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the
idea of their effects. From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and
a lofty ambition; but how am I sunk! Oh! my friend, if you had known me
as I once was, you would not recognize me in this state of degradation.
18. At his entrance to the wider world, Victor felt he had talents that he could use to benefit
society. He expected to put forth greatness in the world and chose the lofty goal of creating
life, but without thinking of the consequences. His high expectations for himself did not temper
his ability to create, and although his accomplishment is amazing, it only serves to torture
him until the bitter end—when he has come to some recognition of the monstrosity of his own
behavior, likening himself to Satan, just as the creature has done. At the start of his efforts to
create life, Victor might have benefited from thinking about the greater repercussions of those
efforts. If it is criminal to throw away those talents, is it not also criminal to use those talents
to invent without caution?

176 FRANKENSTEIN
Despondency rarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on,
until I fell, never, never again to rise.”
Must I then lose this admirable being? I have longed for a friend; I have
sought one who would sympathize with and love me. Behold, on these
desert seas I have found such a one; but, I fear, I have gained him only to
know his value, and lose him. I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses
the idea.
“I thank you, Walton,” he said, “for your kind intentions towards so
miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties, and fresh affections,
think you that any can replace those who are gone? Can any man be to me
as Clerval was; or any woman another Elizabeth? Even where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence, the companions of
our childhood always possess a certain power over our minds, which hardly
any later friend can obtain. They know our infantine dispositions, which,
however they may be afterwards modified, are never eradicated; and they
can judge of our actions with more certain conclusions as to the integrity
of our motives. A sister or a brother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shewn early, suspect the other of fraud or false dealing,
when another friend, however strongly he may be attached, may, in spite
of himself, be invaded with suspicion.19 But I enjoyed friends, dear not only
through habit and association, but from their own merits; and, wherever
I am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth, and the conversation of Clerval,
will be ever whispered in my ear. They are dead; and but one feeling in
such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life. If I were engaged
in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive utility to my
fellow-creatures, then could I live to fulfil it.20 But such is not my destiny;
I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I gave existence; then my lot
on earth will be fulfilled, and I may die.”
19. In this passage, Victor highlights the effect others have on the formation of the self and the
development of personal identity. Others can have, as he points out, “a certain power over our
minds.” Similar to the way others’ perceptions and fears of the creature inevitably influence how
the creature sees himself (as ugly, frightening, and loathsome), Victor’s close companions have
shaped the way he sees himself. As the philosopher Mikhail Bakhtin (1895–1975) proposes,
“A person has no sovereign internal territory, he is wholly and always on the boundary; looking
inside himself, he looks into the eyes of another or with the eyes of another” (1984, 287). Because
a person cannot help but see herself with the eyes of another, Bakhtin says that she becomes
conscious of herself, in fact “becomes herself,” only through her engagement with other people.
Indeed, Victor himself says that Elizabeth’s “existence was bound up in mine” (p. 72).

20. Scientific research today extends Victor’s position here in two conflicting ways. On the one
hand, science is generally perceived as altruistic, a “high undertaking” that produces discoveries
and technologies that can benefit humanity. Over the course of the nineteenth century, the often

MY BELOVED SISTER,
I write to you, encompassed by peril, and ignorant whether I am ever
doomed to see again dear England, and the dearer friends that inhabit
it. I am surrounded by mountains of ice, which admit of no escape, and
threaten every moment to crush my vessel. The brave fellows, whom I
have persuaded to be my companions, look towards me for aid; but I have
none to bestow. There is something terribly appalling in our situation, yet
my courage and hopes do not desert me. We may survive; and if we do not,
I will repeat the lessons of my Seneca,21 and die with a good heart.
Yet what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind? You will not hear
of my destruction, and you will anxiously await my return. Years will
pass, and you will have visitings of despair, and yet be tortured by hope.
ethereal realm of natural philosophy gradually evolved into the practical, empire-building work of
scientific progress. Sir Humphry Davy was urged by his British compatriots to shine the light of
his intellect not just on abstract questions in chemistry but also on the plight of working people in
the midst of the industrial revolution (leading to his invention of a revolutionary new safety lamp
for miners). Benjamin Franklin was iconic not just as a scientist but an inventor and entrepreneur.
On the other hand, the twentieth century saw a new rhetoric come into play. During and after
World War II, an argument emerged to justify scientific research with the claim that humanity
benefits most when scientists selfishly pursue knowledge for its own sake, just as Victor did. Many
science advocates today fiercely defend the principle of basic research, unconstrained by any
attempt to identify pragmatic or utilitarian outcomes.
But it’s the melding of inquiry and practicality that makes science a deeply human pursuit,
and which Victor sees as his only path to redemption. Franklin’s lightening rod, Pasteur’s rabies
vaccine, Bessemer’s steel, Roebling’s Brooklyn Bridge, Edison’s power station, water and sewer
lines, hybrid corn and refrigerators, lasers and fiber optic cables, all are “fraught with extensive
utility” (p. 176) and together add up to that most unpoetic word, “infrastructure,” without which
life would still be fairly nasty, brutish, and short—and science would be nothing but hobbyism.
Daniel Sarewitz and Ed Finn.
21. Seneca: Lucius Annaeus Seneca (ca. 4 BCE–65 CE), “Seneca the Younger,” Roman Stoic
philosopher, playwright, essayist, and tutor and advisor to emperor Nero. Stoicism valued selfrestraint over passion, yet Seneca’s immersion in the excesses of empire brought accusations
of hypocrisy during his lifetime. When he was entangled, possibly falsely, in a plot to assassinate
Nero, Seneca was forced to commit suicide. As recorded by Roman historian Tacitus, his death
was intended to be quick and painless, but became a drawn-out ordeal of bleeding and poison.
Joined forever with the earlier, ennobling death of criminalized philosopher Socrates, Seneca’s
demise is depicted and interpreted in later art and literature as one that cleanses and redeems,
and even baptizes him, as he died in a basin of water. Mary’s Captain Walton, facing his potential
mortality surrounded by ice, notes that he will “die with a good heart,” as did Seneca. Is it possible
that Mary offers him (and, likewise, Victor) “the lessons” of Seneca—and of Socrates—as redemption in the wake of his overly passionate pursuit of knowledge, when he should have practiced
greater self-restraint?

178 FRANKENSTEIN
Oh! my beloved sister, the sickening failings of your heart-felt expectations are, in prospect, more terrible to me than my own death. But you
have a husband, and lovely children; you may be happy: heaven bless you,
and make you so!
My unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion. He
endeavours to fill me with hope; and talks as if life were a possession which
he valued. He reminds me how often the same accidents have happened to
other navigators, who have attempted this sea, and, in spite of myself, he
fills me with cheerful auguries. Even the sailors feel the power of his eloquence: when he speaks, they no longer despair; he rouses their energies,
and, while they hear his voice, they believe these vast mountains of ice are
mole-hills, which will vanish before the resolutions of man. These feelings
are transitory; each day’s expectation delayed fills them with fear, and I
almost dread a mutiny caused by this despair.
September 5th.
A scene has just passed of such uncommon interest, that although it is
highly probable that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot forbear recording it.
We are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger
of being crushed in their conflict. The cold is excessive, and many of my
unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amid this scene of desolation. Frankenstein has daily declined in health: a feverish fire still glimmers in his eyes; but he is exhausted, and, when suddenly roused to any
exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent lifelessness.
I mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny. This
morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend—his eyes
half closed, and his limbs hanging listlessly,—I was roused by half a dozen
of the sailors, who desired admission into the cabin. They entered; and
their leader addressed me. He told me that he and his companions had
been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation to me, to make me
a demand, which, in justice, I could not refuse. We were immured in ice,
and should probably never escape; but they feared that if, as was possible,
the ice should dissipate, and a free passage be opened, I should be rash
enough to continue my voyage, and lead them into fresh dangers, after
they might happily have surmounted this. They desired, therefore, that I
should engage with a solemn promise, that if the vessel should be freed,
I would instantly direct my course southward.
Volume III 179
This speech troubled me. I had not despaired; nor had I yet conceived
the idea of returning, if set free. Yet could I, in justice, or even in possibility, refuse this demand? I hesitated before I answered; when Frankenstein,
who had at first been silent, and, indeed, appeared hardly to have force
enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled, and his cheeks
flushed with momentary vigour. Turning towards the men, he said—
“What do you mean? What do you demand of your captain? Are you then
so easily turned from your design? Did you not call this a glorious expedition? and wherefore was it glorious? Not because the way was smooth and
placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and terror;
because, at every new incident, your fortitude was to be called forth, and
your courage exhibited; because danger and death surrounded, and these
dangers you were to brave and overcome. For this was it a glorious, for
this was it an honourable undertaking. You were hereafter to be hailed as
the benefactors of your species; your names adored, as belonging to brave
men who encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind. And
now, behold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first
mighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away, and are content
to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold
and peril; and so, poor souls, they were chilly, and returned to their warm
fire-sides. Why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come
thus far, and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat, merely to
prove yourselves cowards. Oh! be men, or be more than men. Be steady
to your purposes, and firm as a rock. This ice is not made of such stuff as
your hearts might be; it is mutable, cannot withstand you, if you say that
it shall not. Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace
marked on your brows. Return as heroes who have fought and conquered,
and who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe.”22
He spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings
expressed in his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that
can you wonder that these men were moved. They looked at one another,
22. Here, Victor implores the crewmen to continue their expedition, calling them to be brave
and altruistic in the face of danger. It is ironic that he is encouraging them to do so because
they will be “adored” or “hailed as the benefactors of [their] species,” when similar motives drove
the construction of his creature and ultimately led to his own misery and demise. This passage
illustrates the complexity of Victor’s—and perhaps humankind’s—motives and desires; altruistic
motives can be mingled with hubris and pride. As such, introspection and intentional self-reflection
are necessary for uncovering what is driving our decision making, especially in high-stakes
situations.

and were unable to reply. I spoke; I told them to retire, and consider of
what had been said: that I would not lead them further north, if they strenuously desired the contrary; but that I hoped that, with reflection, their
courage would return.
They retired, and I turned towards my friend; but he was sunk in languor, and almost deprived of life.
How all this will terminate, I know not; but I had rather die, than
return shamefully,—my purpose unfulfilled. Yet I fear such will be my fate;
the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never willingly
continue to endure their present hardships.
September 7th.
The die is cast; I have consented to return, if we are not destroyed. Thus
are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; I come back ignorant
and disappointed. It requires more philosophy than I possess, to bear this
injustice with patience.23
September 12th.
It is past; I am returning to England. I have lost my hopes of utility and
glory;—I have lost my friend. But I will endeavour to detail these bitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and, while I am wafted towards England,
and towards you, I will not despond.
September 9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were
heard at a distance, as the islands split and cracked in every direction.
We were in the most imminent peril; but, as we could only remain passive,
my chief attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest, whose illness
increased in such a degree, that he was entirely confined to his bed. The
ice cracked behind us, and was driven with force towards the north; a
breeze sprung from the west, and on the 11th the passage towards the south
became perfectly free. When the sailors saw this, and that their return to
their native country was apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy
23. In many ways, Walton appears to be the embodiment of everything Victor is not. He rescues
and befriends a man who at the beginning of his tale is more of a monster than his creation and at
the end is on equal terms with the creature in that both have been twisted by grief, rage, and the
desire for vengeance. Walton undertakes a quest for knowledge with the awareness that it may
cost him his life. He makes and endeavors to fulfill promises to Victor based solely on the bonds of
platonic friendship. When the ice threatens to kill him and his mates in his pursuit of knowledge,
he does not flinch, and initially from his perspective it is only the cowardice of lesser men that turns
him aside.

broke from them, loud and long-continued. Frankenstein, who was dozing,
awoke, and asked the cause of the tumult. “They shout,” I said, “because
they will soon return to England.”
“Do you then really return?”
“Alas! yes; I cannot withstand their demands. I cannot lead them
unwillingly to danger, and I must return.”
“Do so, if you will; but I will not. You may give up your purpose; but
mine is assigned to me by heaven, and I dare not. I am weak; but surely the
spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with sufficient strength.”
Saying this, he endeavoured to spring from the bed, but the exertion was
too great for him; he fell back, and fainted.
It was long before he was restored; and I often thought that life was
entirely extinct. At length he opened his eyes, but he breathed with difficulty, and was unable to speak. The surgeon gave him a composing draught,
and ordered us to leave him undisturbed. In the mean time he told me,
that my friend had certainly not many hours to live.
His sentence was pronounced; and I could only grieve, and be patient.
I sat by his bed watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept;
but presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and, bidding me come near,
said—“Alas! the strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall soon die, and
he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being. Think not, Walton, that
in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning hatred, and ardent
desire of revenge, I once expressed, but I feel myself justified in desiring
the death of my adversary. During these last days I have been occupied in
examining my past conduct; nor do I find it blameable. In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature, and was bound towards him,
to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and well-being. This
was my duty; but there was another still paramount to that. My duties
towards my fellow-creatures had greater claims to my attention,24 because
24. Mary’s “creature” is vegetarian: “My food is not that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the
kid, to glut my appetite; acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment” (p. 121). The creature
rationalizes and demonstrates his “humanity” in exhibiting empathy toward other creatures that
he likens similar to himself, and therefore Mary more than hints that this creature has a nurturing
side. Naming a pet makes it more than animal, and Victor never gives a name to his experimental
human. Despite his admission so late in the narrative that his creation is rational and deserves
well-being, for Victor the creature never ceases to be his laboratory “rat.” Western objectivity proceeds from the European Enlightenment; however, we identify with emotionally engaging things
such as embryonic stem cells because they derive from human embryos and are the stems of all
human cells. Are all “harvested” embryonic stem cells in a situational and transitory “disposition”
of animacy, with innate capacity to transform and mature into a human if placed within a
womb rather than in a lab to be used for research? Is Mary’s creature, in stating that he does not
eat meat (use the flesh) of other animals, indicating that he is more humane in some respects

they included a greater proportion of happiness or misery. Urged by this
view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to create a companion for the
first creature. He shewed unparalleled malignity and selfishness, in evil:
he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction beings who possessed
exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I know where this
thirst for vengeance may end. Miserable himself, that he may render no
other wretched, he ought to die. The task of his destruction was mine, but
I have failed. When actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I asked you to
undertake my unfinished work; and I renew this request now, when I am
only induced by reason and virtue.
“Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends, to fulfil
this task; and now, that you are returning to England, you will have little
chance of meeting with him. But the consideration of these points, and the
well-balancing of what you may esteem your duties, I leave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near approach of death. I dare
not ask you to do what I think right, for I may still be misled by passion.
“That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in
other respects this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the
only happy one which I have enjoyed for several years. The forms of the
beloved dead flit before me, and I hasten to their arms. Farewell, Walton!
Seek happiness in tranquillity, and avoid ambition, even if it be only the
apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in science and discoveries. Yet why do I say this? I have myself been blasted in these hopes, yet
another may succeed.”25
than humans? Embryonic stem cells, during and after research, are eventually destroyed, so do
they have the same life value as a “the lamb and the kid,” or do they have less? More? Or none?
How would Mary’s “creature,” the vegetarian, answer the previous question?

25. Despite praising his friend Walton for his virtuous actions, particularly in the episode of love he
recounts, Victor criticizes his lack of imagination. He further suggests that the inability to think
further than the ship’s ropes and shroud (the nautical term for a cable, typically part of a pattern of
lines used to stay a ship’s mast) is the result of having spent his life aboard a ship. Mary encapsulates an important romantic idea in this suggestion. Empiricists of the time argued for the metaphor of the tabula rasa to explain the concept that people’s minds, like a wax tablet, encounter the
world blank and directly collect impressions. They held that human minds could be made blank
for observation. In contrast, the romantics developed a view that what can be observed is affected
by what is already in the mind. This theory explains the difference in perceptions that two people
might have in encountering the same landscape, personage, or natural wonder. To Victor, Walton
has a limited imagination because his experience has been limited to life aboard a ship, in contrast
to Victor’s own childhood and educational experiences, which he believes shaped his mind for
scientific work.

His voice became fainter as he spoke; and at length, exhausted by his
effort, he sunk into silence. About half an hour afterwards he attempted
again to speak, but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and his eyes
closed for ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed away from
his lips.
Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of
this glorious spirit? What can I say, that will enable you to understand the
depth of my sorrow? All that I should express would be inadequate and
feeble. My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of disappointment. But I journey towards England, and I may there find consolation.
I am interrupted. What do these sounds portend? It is midnight; the
breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir. Again; there is a
sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin where the
remains of Frankenstein still lie. I must arise, and examine. Good night,
my sister.
Great God! what a scene has just taken place! I am yet dizzy with the
remembrance of it. I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail
it; yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without this
final and wonderful catastrophe.
I entered the cabin, where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable
friend. Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to describe; gigantic
in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its proportions. As he hung over
the coffin, his face was concealed by long locks of ragged hair; but one vast
hand was extended, in colour and apparent texture like that of a mummy.
When he heard the sound of my approach, he ceased to utter exclamations
of grief and horror, and sprung towards the window. Never did I behold a
vision so horrible as his face, of such loathsome, yet appalling hideousness.
I shut my eyes involuntarily, and endeavoured to recollect what were my
duties with regard to this destroyer. I called on him to stay.
He paused, looking on me with wonder; and, again turning towards
the lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and every
feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some uncontrollable passion.
“That is also my victim!” he exclaimed; “in his murder my crimes are
consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its close! Oh,
Frankenstein! generous and self-devoted being! what does it avail that I
now ask thee to pardon me? I, who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all thou lovedst. Alas! he is cold; he may not answer me.”
His voice seemed suffocated; and my first impulses, which had suggested
to me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend, in destroying his 
184 FRANKENSTEIN
enemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion. I
approached this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my looks upon
his face, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness. I
attempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips. The monster continued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches. At length I gathered
resolution to address him, in a pause of the tempest of his passion: “Your
repentance,” I said, “is now superfluous. If you had listened to the voice of
conscience,26 and heeded the stings of remorse, before you had urged your
diabolical vengeance to this extremity, Frankenstein would yet have lived.”
“And do you dream?” said the dæmon; “do you think that I was then
dead to agony and remorse?—He,” he continued, pointing to the corpse,
“he suffered not more in the consummation of the deed;—oh! not the tenthousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the lingering detail
of its execution. A frightful selfishness hurried me on, while my heart was
poisoned with remorse. Think ye that the groans of Clerval were music to
my ears? My heart was fashioned to be susceptible of love and sympathy;
and, when wrenched by misery to vice and hatred, it did not endure the
violence of the change without torture, such as you cannot even imagine.
“After the murder of Clerval, I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken and
overcome. I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror: I abhorred
myself. But when I discovered that he, the author at once of my existence
and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for happiness; that while
he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me, he sought his own
enjoyment in feelings and passions from the indulgence of which I was for
ever barred, then impotent envy and bitter indignation filled me with an
insatiable thirst for vengeance. I recollected my threat, and resolved that
it should be accomplished. I knew that I was preparing for myself a deadly
torture; but I was the slave, not the master of an impulse, which I detested,
yet could not disobey. Yet when she died!—nay, then I was not miserable.
I had cast off all feeling, subdued all anguish to riot in the excess of my
despair. Evil thenceforth became my good. Urged thus far, I had no choice
but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly chosen. The
completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable passion. And
now it is ended; there is my last victim!”
26. Having heard the creature’s expression of appreciation for Victor’s efforts and his remorse
for his own inexcusable actions, spoken to the now dead Victor, Walton rejects these statements
as vain. The creature could have chosen to listen to his conscience, which was able to discern
right from wrong, instead of seeking vengeance. The creature’s gratitude should have overcome
whatever sense of rejection he experienced.
Joel Gereboff.
Volume III 185
I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet when I
called to mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and
persuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my friend,
indignation was re-kindled within me. “Wretch!” I said, “it is well that you
come here to whine over the desolation that you have made. You throw a
torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are consumed you sit among
the ruins, and lament the fall. Hypocritical fiend! if he whom you mourn
still lived, still would he be the object, again would he become the prey
of your accursed vengeance. It is not pity that you feel; you lament only
because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn from your power.”
“Oh, it is not thus—not thus,” interrupted the being; “yet such must
be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to be the purport of
my actions. Yet I seek not a fellow-feeling in my misery. No sympathy may
I ever find. When I first sought it, it was the love of virtue, the feelings
of happiness and affection with which my whole being overflowed, that I
wished to be participated. But now, that virtue has become to me a shadow,
and that happiness and affection are turned into bitter and loathing
despair, in what should I seek for sympathy? I am content to suffer alone,
while my sufferings shall endure: when I die, I am well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. Once my fancy was soothed
with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once I falsely hoped to
meet with beings, who, pardoning my outward form, would love me for the
excellent qualities which I was capable of bringing forth. I was nourished
with high thoughts of honour and devotion. But now vice has degraded
me beneath the meanest animal. No crime, no mischief, no malignity, no
misery, can be found comparable to mine. When I call over the frightful
catalogue of my deeds, I cannot believe that I am he whose thoughts were
once filled with sublime and transcendant visions of the beauty and the
majesty of goodness. But it is even so; the fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man had friends and associates
in his desolation; I am quite alone.
“You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge
of my crimes and his misfortunes. But, in the detail which he gave you of
them, he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured,
wasting in impotent passions. For whilst I destroyed his hopes, I did not
satisfy my own desires. They were for ever ardent and craving; still I
desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned. Was there no injustice
in this? Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all human kind sinned
against me? Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his friend from his door
with contumely? Why do you not execrate the rustic who sought to destroy 
186 FRANKENSTEIN
the saviour of his child? Nay, these are virtuous and immaculate beings! I,
the miserable and the abandoned, am an abortion, to be spurned at, and
kicked, and trampled on. Even now my blood boils at the recollection of
this injustice.
“But it is true that I am a wretch. I have murdered the lovely and the
helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept, and grasped to death
his throat who never injured me or any other living thing. I have devoted
my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and admiration
among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that irremediable ruin.
There he lies, white and cold in death. You hate me; but your abhorrence
cannot equal that with which I regard myself. I look on the hands which
executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the imagination of it was
conceived, and long for the moment when they will meet my eyes, when it
will haunt my thoughts, no more.
“Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief. My work is
nearly complete. Neither your’s nor any man’s death is needed to consummate the series of my being, and accomplish that which must be done;
but it requires my own.27 Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this
sacrifice. I shall quit your vessel on the ice-raft which brought me hither,
and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shall collect my
funeral pile, and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its remains
may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch, who would create such another as I have been. I shall die. I shall no longer feel the agonies which now consume me, or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet
unquenched. He is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be no
more, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish. I shall no longer see the sun or stars, or feel the winds play on my cheeks. Light, feeling,
and sense, will pass away; and in this condition must I find my happiness.
27. Here Mary anticipates one of the most serious debates about unintended consequences
confronting contemporary scientists and technologists. How can we be sure that new creations
we bring into the world will remain constrained, controlled, and limited in the ways that we
expect them to be? One popular example of this discussion is the “grey goo” argument. Imagine
a modern-day Victor creating a kind of self-replicating nanotechnology that can harness certain
resources in the environment to copy itself. Without the proper controls, such an entity could
destroy everything on the planet within a matter of days, turning the world into a grey goo of
seething nanobots.
The creature’s description of his plan for self-destruction is one of the most poignant explorations of a correlated problem—if the new technology in question is not only autonomous but
in some way self-aware, the imposition of safety limits may mean asking our creations to enact a
kind of suicide.
Ed Finn.
Volume III 187
Some years ago, when the images which this world affords first opened
upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer, and heard the rustling of the leaves and the chirping of the birds, and these were all to me, I
should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation. Polluted by crimes,
and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in death?
“Farewell! I leave you, and in you the last of human kind whom these
eyes will ever behold. Farewell, Frankenstein! If thou wert yet alive, and
yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better satiated
in my life than in my destruction. But it was not so; thou didst seek my
extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness; and if yet, in some
mode unknown to me, thou hast not yet ceased to think and feel, thou
desirest not my life for my own misery. Blasted as thou wert, my agony
was still superior to thine; for the bitter sting of remorse may not cease to
rankle in my wounds until death shall close them for ever.
“But soon,” he cried, with sad and solemn enthusiasm, “I shall die, and
what I now feel be no longer felt. Soon these burning miseries will be
extinct. I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly, and exult in the agony
of the torturing flames.28 The light of that conflagration will fade away; my
ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds. My spirit will sleep in peace;
or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus. Farewell.”
He sprung from the cabin-window, as he said this, upon the ice-raft
which lay close to the vessel. He was soon borne away by the waves, and
lost in darkness and distance.
THE END.
28. The creature’s final words describe his plans for a noble suicide (see note 21 on the death
of Seneca, and note 27 on self-sacrificing technologies). The creature’s decision to “repeat the
lessons of my Seneca, and die with a good heart” (p. 177) has many echoes in contemporary
representations of some autonomous technology sacrificing itself for the good of humanity.
In Terminator 2: Judgment Day, the superhuman robot played by Arnold Schwarzenegger
makes a similar sacrifice, lowering itself into a pool of molten metal in order to protect
John and Sarah Connor.
As autonomous systems become more prevalent—think of self-driving cars—the question of
how to encode ethical judgment in them has become far more pressing. Perhaps it seems obvious
that a self-driving car should sacrifice itself before allowing a human pedestrian to be harmed.
But how should such a system react when it must choose between injuring its driver or hitting a
pedestrian? As Victor and the creature have discovered, most of our moral decisions involve
some risk of harming others and force us to grapple with ethical ambiguity.
Ed Finn.

The Publishers of the Standard Novels, in selecting “Frankenstein” for one
of their series, expressed a wish that I should furnish them with some
account of the origin of the story. I am the more willing to comply, because
I shall thus give a general answer to the question, so frequently asked
me—“How I, then a young girl, came to think of, and to dilate upon, so
very hideous an idea?” It is true that I am very averse to bringing myself
forward in print; but as my account will only appear as an appendage to a
former production, and as it will be confined to such topics as have connection with my authorship alone, I can scarcely accuse myself of a personal
intrusion.
It is not singular that, as the daughter of two persons of distinguished
literary celebrity, I should very early in life have thought of writing. As a
child I scribbled; and my favourite pastime, during the hours given me for
recreation, was to “write stories.” Still I had a dearer pleasure than this,
which was the formation of castles in the air—the indulging in waking
dreams—the following up trains of thought, which had for their subject the
formation of a succession of imaginary incidents. My dreams were at once
more fantastic and agreeable than my writings. In the latter I was a close
imitator—rather doing as others had done, than putting down the suggestions of my own mind. What I wrote was intended at least for one other
eye—my childhood’s companion and friend; but my dreams were all my
own; I accounted for them to nobody; they were my refuge when annoyed—
my dearest pleasure when free.
I lived principally in the country as a girl, and passed a considerable
time in Scotland. I made occasional visits to the more picturesque parts;
but my habitual residence was on the blank and dreary northern shores of
the Tay, near Dundee. Blank and dreary on retrospection I call them; they
were not so to me then. They were the eyry of freedom, and the pleasant
region where unheeded I could commune with the creatures of my fancy. I
wrote then—but in a most common-place style. It was beneath the trees of
the grounds belonging to our house, or on the bleak sides of the woodless
mountains near, that my true compositions, the airy flights of my imagination, were born and fostered. I did not make myself the heroine of my tales.

190 INTRODUCTION TO FRANKENSTEIN (1831)
Life appeared to me too common-place an affair as regarded myself. I could
not figure to myself that romantic woes or wonderful events would ever be
my lot; but I was not confined to my own identity, and I could people the
hours with creations far more interesting to me at that age, than my own
sensations.
After this my life became busier, and reality stood in place of fiction.
My husband, however, was from the first, very anxious that I should prove
myself worthy of my parentage, and enrol myself on the page of fame. He
was for ever inciting me to obtain literary reputation, which even on my
own part I cared for then, though since I have become infinitely indifferent
to it. At this time he desired that I should write, not so much with the idea
that I could produce any thing worthy of notice, but that he might himself
judge how far I possessed the promise of better things hereafter. Still I did
nothing. Travelling, and the cares of a family, occupied my time; and study,
in the way of reading, or improving my ideas in communication with his
far more cultivated mind, was all of literary employment that engaged my
attention.
In the summer of 1816, we visited Switzerland, and became the neighbours of Lord Byron. At first we spent our pleasant hours on the lake, or
wandering on its shores; and Lord Byron, who was writing the third canto
of Childe Harold, was the only one among us who put his thoughts upon
paper. These, as he brought them successively to us, clothed in all the light
and harmony of poetry, seemed to stamp as divine the glories of heaven
and earth, whose influences we partook with him.
But it proved a wet, ungenial summer, and incessant rain often confined us for days to the house. Some volumes of ghost stories, translated
from the German into French, fell into our hands. There was the History
of the Inconstant Lover, who, when he thought to clasp the bride to whom
he had pledged his vows, found himself in the arms of the pale ghost of
her whom he had deserted. There was the tale of the sinful founder of his
race, whose miserable doom it was to bestow the kiss of death on all the
younger sons of his fated house, just when they reached the age of promise.
His gigantic, shadowy form, clothed like the ghost in Hamlet, in complete
armour, but with the beaver up, was seen at midnight, by the moon’s fitful beams, to advance slowly along the gloomy avenue. The shape was lost
beneath the shadow of the castle walls; but soon a gate swung back, a step
was heard, the door of the chamber opened, and he advanced to the couch
of the blooming youths, cradled in healthy sleep. Eternal sorrow sat upon
his face as he bent down and kissed the forehead of the boys, who from
that hour withered like flowers snapt upon the stalk. I have not seen these 
INTRODUCTION TO FRANKENSTEIN (1831) 191
stories since then; but their incidents are as fresh in my mind as if I had
read them yesterday.
“We will each write a ghost story,” said Lord Byron; and his proposition
was acceded to. There were four of us. The noble author began a tale, a
fragment of which he printed at the end of his poem of Mazeppa. Shelley,
more apt to embody ideas and sentiments in the radiance of brilliant imagery, and in the music of the most melodious verse that adorns our language,
than to invent the machinery of a story, commenced one founded on the
experiences of his early life. Poor Polidori had some terrible idea about a
skull-headed lady, who was so punished for peeping through a key-hole—
what to see I forget—something very shocking and wrong of course; but
when she was reduced to a worse condition than the renowned Tom of
Coventry, he did not know what to do with her, and was obliged to despatch
her to the tomb of the Capulets, the only place for which she was fitted.
The illustrious poets also, annoyed by the platitude of prose, speedily relinquished the uncongenial task.
I busied myself to think of a story,—a story to rival those which had
excited us to this task. One which would speak to the mysterious fears of
our nature, and awaken thrilling horror—one to make the reader dread to
look round, to curdle the blood, and quicken the beatings of the heart. If I
did not accomplish these things, my ghost story would be unworthy of its
name. I thought and pondered—vainly. I felt that blank incapability of
invention which is the greatest misery of authorship, when dull Nothing
replies to our anxious invocations. Have you thought of a story? I was asked
each morning, and each morning I was forced to reply with a mortifying
negative.
Every thing must have a beginning, to speak in Sanchean phrase; and
that beginning must be linked to something that went before. The Hindoos
give the world an elephant to support it, but they make the elephant stand
upon a tortoise. Invention, it must be humbly admitted, does not consist
in creating out of void, but out of chaos; the materials must, in the first
place, be afforded: it can give form to dark, shapeless substances, but cannot bring into being the substance itself. In all matters of discovery and
invention, even of those that appertain to the imagination, we are continually reminded of the story of Columbus and his egg. Invention consists in
the capacity of seizing on the capabilities of a subject, and in the power of
moulding and fashioning ideas suggested to it.
Many and long were the conversations between Lord Byron and Shelley,
to which I was a devout but nearly silent listener. During one of these, various philosophical doctrines were discussed, and among others the nature 
192 INTRODUCTION TO FRANKENSTEIN (1831)
of the principle of life, and whether there was any probability of its ever
being discovered and communicated. They talked of the experiments of
Dr. Darwin, (I speak not of what the Doctor really did, or said that he did,
but, as more to my purpose, of what was then spoken of as having been
done by him,) who preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case, till by
some extraordinary means it began to move with voluntary motion. Not
thus, after all, would life be given. Perhaps a corpse would be re-animated;
galvanism had given token of such things: perhaps the component parts
of a creature might be manufactured, brought together, and endued with
vital warmth.
Night waned upon this talk; and even the witching hour had gone by,
before we retired to rest. When I placed my head on my pillow, I did not
sleep, nor could I be said to think. My imagination, unbidden, possessed
and guided me, gifting the successive images that arose in my mind with
a vividness far beyond the usual bounds of reverie. I saw—with shut eyes,
but acute mental vision—I saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together. I saw the hideous phantasm of a
man stretched out, and then, on the working of some powerful engine, show
signs of life, and stir with an uneasy, half vital motion. Frightful must it
be; for supremely frightful would be the effect of any human endeavour
to mock the stupendous mechanism of the Creator of the world. His success would terrify the artist; he would rush away from his odious handywork, horror-stricken. He would hope that, left to itself, the slight spark
of life which he had communicated would fade; that this thing, which had
received such imperfect animation, would subside into dead matter; and
he might sleep in the belief that the silence of the grave would quench for
ever the transient existence of the hideous corpse which he had looked
upon as the cradle of life. He sleeps; but he is awakened; he opens his eyes;
behold the horrid thing stands at his bedside, opening his curtains, and
looking on him with yellow, watery, but speculative eyes.
I opened mine in terror. The idea so possessed my mind, that a thrill
of fear ran through me, and I wished to exchange the ghastly image of my
fancy for the realities around. I see them still; the very room, the dark parquet, the closed shutters, with the moonlight struggling through, and the
sense I had that the glassy lake and white high Alps were beyond. I could
not so easily get rid of my hideous phantom; still it haunted me. I must
try to think of something else. I recurred to my ghost story,—my tiresome
unlucky ghost story! O! if I could only contrive one which would frighten
my reader as I myself had been frightened that night!
INTRODUCTION TO FRANKENSTEIN (1831) 193
Swift as light and as cheering was the idea that broke in upon me.
“I have found it! What terrified me will terrify others; and I need only
describe the spectre which had haunted my midnight pillow.” On the morrow I announced that I had thought of a story. I began that day with the
words, It was on a dreary night of November, making only a transcript of
the grim terrors of my waking dream.
At first I thought but of a few pages—of a short tale; but Shelley urged
me to develope the idea at greater length. I certainly did not owe the suggestion of one incident, nor scarcely of one train of feeling, to my husband,
and yet but for his incitement, it would never have taken the form in which
it was presented to the world. From this declaration I must except the preface. As far as I can recollect, it was entirely written by him.
And now, once again, I bid my hideous progeny go forth and prosper. I
have an affection for it, for it was the offspring of happy days, when death
and grief were but words, which found no true echo in my heart. Its several
pages speak of many a walk, many a drive, and many a conversation, when
I was not alone; and my companion was one whom, in this world, I shall
never see more. But this is for myself; my readers have nothing to do with
these associations.
I will add but one word as to the alterations I have made. They are principally those of style. I have changed no portion of the story, nor introduced
any new ideas or circumstances. I have mended the language where it was
so bald as to interfere with the interest of the narrative; and these changes
occur almost exclusively in the beginning of the first volume. Throughout
they are entirely confined to such parts as are mere adjuncts to the story,
leaving the core and substance of it untouched.

TRAUMATIC RESPONSIBILITY
VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN AS CREATOR AND CASUALTY
JOSEPHINE JOHNSTON
A rich theme running through Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein is responsibility. In a straightforward—even didactic—way, the novel chronicles the
devastating consequences for an inventor and those he loves of his utter
failure to anticipate the harm that can result from raw, unchecked scientific curiosity. The novel not only explores the responsibility that Victor Frankenstein has for the destruction caused by his creation but also
examines the responsibility he owes to him. The creature is a new being,
with emotions and desires and dreams that he quickly learns cannot be
satisfied by humans, who are repulsed by his appearance and terrified of
his brute strength. So the creature comes to Victor, pleading—and then
demanding—that he create a female companion with whom he can experience peace and love. While Victor is grappling intellectually and practically
with the implications of being responsible both for and to the creature, he
is also experiencing responsibility as a devastating physical and emotional
state. In this way, Mary Shelley raises a third aspect of responsibility—its
impact on the self.
What Is Responsibility?
The word responsibility is a noun defined as either a duty to take care of
something or someone or the state of being the cause of an outcome. The
word is familiar to everyone. Indeed, we order our daily lives based on our
ideas about responsibility, whether we are referring to the duties we have
to care for others—for instance, children—or our understandings about
who or what has caused there to be food on our plates or a drought in
California. The concept is especially important to students of philosophy
and law.
In philosophy, special attention is paid to the concept of “moral responsibility,” which refers not to a cause-and-effect relationship nor to the duties
that come with occupying particular roles in society but to the determination
that someone deserves praise or blame for an outcome or state of affairs.
Humans’ ability to be held morally responsible is closely tied up with the
ideas about the nature of persons—specifically that persons have the
capacity to be morally responsible agents. In Frankenstein, Mary raises 
202 Josephine Johnston
questions about who is and is not capable of moral responsibility. At the
beginning of the book, she introduces a protagonist who appears capable
of being held morally responsible for his actions and an antagonist (the
creature) who does not. But as the story develops, she raises questions
about which of the two is the truly rational actor—Victor, who is addled by
ambition, fever, and guilt, or the creature, who acquires emotion, language,
and an intellect.
In law, responsibility is generally attributed in a two-step process.
Judges and juries are first asked to determine whether the person caused
the outcome in question—Did the accused pull the trigger on the gun that
fired the bullet that killed the victim? They must then decide whether
the person did so with the requisite intent, called mens rea. A killer who
intended to kill the victim could be guilty of first-degree murder, but the
legal responsibility assigned to someone who shot the victim accidentally
might be manslaughter or another less-serious offense. A number of factors can interfere with legal responsibility, such as age (children are generally excused), compulsion (if someone has a gun to your head, you might
not be held responsible for the actions they instruct you to perform), and
mental defect (e.g., insanity). As with the determination of moral responsibility in a court of law, an attempt to attribute legal responsibility in
Frankenstein quickly becomes complex. Although it might initially seem
that Victor should be the one held legally responsible not just for the existence of the creature but for the havoc he wreaks, we also must consider
that the creature quickly develops the capacity for rational thought, raising the possibility that he may qualify as an actor capable of both causing
harm and forming the intention to do so. Given the sophisticated way the
creature develops, by the end of the book he alone might be held legally
responsible for the deaths he causes.
Victor experiences the two basic meanings of the word responsibility.
He creates the creature (he causes it to exist), and therefore he has at least
some responsibility for what the creature goes on to do. As the creature’s
maker, Victor also has both a duty to others to keep them safe from his
creation and, Mary seems to be saying, a duty to his creation to ensure that
his existence is worthwhile. We will turn to these two ideas now—responsibility for and responsibility to.
Responsibility for Our Creations
In a very straightforward way, Victor causes the monster to exist. He builds
him, freely and with the hope, indeed the intention, that he will come to life. 
Traumatic Responsibility 203
This creation is no accident. Although many factors can arguably interfere
with attributions of responsibility—including compulsion and delusion—
there is no suggestion that Victor does not intend to make the creature,
despite the frenzied way he goes about it. Indeed, Victor anticipates his
future responsibility for the existence of the creature with pleasure and
excitement—even triumph: “A new species would bless me as its creator
and source; many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to
me. No father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I
should deserve their’s” (p. 37).
Victor’s error is failing to think harder about the potential repercussions
of his work. Although he says that he hesitated for a long time about how
to use the “astonishing” (p. 35) power to “bestow animation upon lifeless
matter” (p. 37), this hesitation is due to the many technical hurdles that he
needs to overcome rather than to any concern for the questionable results
of success. He considers the good that might come from his discovery—
it might lead to development of a method for bringing the dead back to
life—but he fails to consider the future of his initial experimental creation.
Although he is aware that the single-minded pursuit of his scientific goals
is throwing his life out of balance, he utterly fails to consider the possibility that the form he has stitched together and will soon animate may go
on to cause harm to anyone, including Victor himself. We might compare
Victor to some modern scientists who have stopped their work to consider
its potential for harm, such as those who gathered at Asilomar in the mid1970s to consider the implications of research on recombinant DNA or
those who recently called for a moratorium on germline gene editing.
Victor’s failure to thoroughly anticipate responsibility—to consider
that there might be both upsides and downsides to his technical achievement—is his downfall. As soon as the creature opens his “dull yellow eye”
(p. 41), Victor is filled with “breathless horror and disgust” (p. 42). He flees,
initially so agitated he is unable to stand still, eventually falling into a
nightmare-filled sleep in which he sees his fiancée, Elizabeth, first “in the
bloom of health” (p. 43) and then as a rotting corpse. Victor is woken by the
creature but “escape[s]” again (p. 43). He is unable to face his creation and
is unprepared for the creature’s independent existence.
As the story progresses, Victor’s initial emotional reactions to seeing the
creature come to life—disgust and horror—are substantiated by the creature’s actions. Victor learns that the creature has killed his young brother
William, whose death is then blamed on a family friend, Justine. But Victor knows the truth. He understands that he would be implicated in her
execution if she is convicted as well as in the murder of his brother—“the 
204 Josephine Johnston
result of my curiosity and lawless devices would cause the death of two of
my fellow-beings” (p. 62). He suffers greatly under this guilt—“the tortures
of the accused did not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the
fangs of remorse tore my bosom, and would not forego their hold” (p. 65).
But he does nothing to intervene. The girl is unjustly convicted. “I, not in
deed, but in effect, was the true murderer” (p. 75).
Victor continues to hold himself responsible for both the existence of
the horrifying creature and the creature’s deadly deeds. He spends his
remaining days on earth chasing the creature across the Arctic, intending
to kill him. But in this understanding of his responsibility, he is alone—no
one else in the novel sees Victor as anything but a casualty of unspeakable
misfortune. Although he is at one time accused of murdering his friend
Henry Clerval—who is killed by the creature—that charge is eventually
dropped (ironically, as Victor leaves the prison, an observer remarks, “He
may be innocent of the murder, but he has certainly a bad conscience” [p.
153]). Even Robert Walton, the explorer who encounters Victor on the ice
and to whom Victor narrates his entire story, judges him to be noble, gentle,
and wise. It is left to Victor’s own conscience—and to the reader—to assess
the extent to which he should be held responsible for the creature’s deeds.
On this question, Victor is resolved. Although he allows that he did not
intend to create a creature capable of such evil, he continues to hold himself responsible for the creature’s existence and for the deaths the creature
causes, and he dies believing himself duty bound toward his fellow creatures to destroy his creation.
Responsibility to Our Creations
On his deathbed, Victor also acknowledges that he is not just responsible
for the creature but also responsible to him: “I … was bound towards him,
to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and well-being” (p. 181).
The creature himself makes this argument forcefully when he confronts
Victor in the mountains overlooking the Chamonix Valley. The creature
relates all that has transpired since Victor abandoned him. He has learned
to find food and shelter. By closely observing a human family, he has
learned about emotion and relationships as well as how to speak and read.
By finding a collection of books, he learns the rudiments of human society
and history. Yet on each attempt to engage with humans, the creature is
disastrously rejected—sometimes even attacked. He learns that humans
are repulsed by him. Concluding that humans will never accept him into
their moral community, he comes to see humans as the enemy. He now 
Traumatic Responsibility 205
lays his pain and loneliness at Victor’s feet: “Unfeeling, heartless creator!
you had endowed me with perceptions and passions, and then cast me
abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind. But on you only had
I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I determined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from any other being that wore the
human form” (p. 116).
To assuage his loneliness, rage, and pain, the creature demands that
Victor “create a female for me, with whom I can live in the interchange of
those sympathies necessary for my being” (p. 120). The creature tries to
reason with Victor: “Oh! my creator, make me happy; let me feel gratitude
towards you for one benefit! Let me see that I excite the sympathy of some
existing thing; do not deny me my request!” (p. 121). Although Victor’s
sympathies are stirred by the creature’s story and his plea for companionship, Victor immediately refuses out of a sense of responsibility to protect
the world from “wickedness” (p. 139).
By having her inventor create a sentient being—in particular one whose
intellect and emotions rival or surpass those of her supposed protagonist—
Mary sharpens the point about the responsibility that we might owe to
our creations. Parents understand this point (and in many ways Victor
is placed in the role of a parent—albeit one who rejects and abandons his
child). And so must scientists working to create new or modified life-forms
carry a responsibility to their creations. We can take the point even further:
a sense of responsibility can be experienced by anyone who pours time
and energy into a project, even if that project does not result in a new life
form. We can legitimately speak about feeling an obligation to our work—
including to our results, our ideas, or our findings—that it deserves to be
published or further developed or recognized as valuable not only because
it can benefit others or result in glory for ourselves but because of the
intrinsic value of new knowledge.
Responsibility as an Experience
One of the most striking aspects of Mary’s treatment of responsibility is her
depiction of its emotional and physical toll. Before Victor gains any insight
into the deadly consequences of his scientific work or the onerous duties
he has thereby acquired, he experiences responsibility as an emotional and
physical state. At the very moment he animates his creation, “the beauty of
the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart” (p.
42). He runs from the room, paces back and forth, “unable to compose my
mind to sleep” (p. 42), falls into a sleep filled with nightmares portending 
206 Josephine Johnston
the death of his fiancée, and wakes in a cold sweat with his limbs convulsing. He goes outside and by chance meets his friend Henry Clerval, who
notices his agitated mood and then spends several months nursing Victor
through a “nervous fever” during which “the form of the monster on whom
I had bestowed existence was for ever before my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him” (p. 46).
Victor recovers from this first episode, but his recovery is short-lived.
As the creature kills his family and friends, Victor grapples with the realization that he is responsible for the existence of the creature and to a
certain extent is therefore responsible for the creature’s deeds. His grief at
the death of little William and then of Henry are compounded and tainted
by his guilt at the role he has played in their deaths. He cannot sleep,
and his physical health declines. His concerned father implores him to
move beyond his grief and reenter the world, “for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment, or even the discharge of daily usefulness,
without which no man is fit for society.” But Victor is unable to respond:
“I should have been the first to hide my grief, and console my friends, if
remorse had not mingled its bitterness with my other sensations” (p. 72).
As the story progresses, Victor continues to suffer emotionally and
physically. His family and friends are alarmed and try to help him, but
Victor cannot be reached. He withdraws from their company, floating aimlessly on a boat on the lake, unable to find peace. He hikes in the mountains during a rainstorm. He travels to England, ostensibly to see the world
before settling down in marriage but in reality to build another creature.
He describes the time as “two years of exile” (p. 130), and he bemoans
his inability to enjoy the journey or the people he meets on his way. He
describes a visit to Oxford, noting that he “enjoyed this scene; and yet my
enjoyment was embittered both by the memory of the past, and the anticipation of the future. … I am a blasted tree; the bolt has entered my soul;
and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit, what I shall soon cease
to be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity, pitiable to others, and
abhorrent to myself ” (p. 135).
As the book concludes, Victor lay dying in Walton’s boat. The explorer
and the reader are left in no doubt about what has killed him. When the
creature boards the boat and sees the newly dead Victor, he claims responsibility for his death—“That is also my victim!” the creature exclaims.
“I, who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all thou lovedst” (p. 183).
Yet it is not only the loss of his family and friends that destroys Victor but
also the guilt and remorse that came with being the one who so naively
created the creature and gave him life.
Traumatic Responsibility 207
Conclusion
In Frankenstein, Mary Shelley explores at least three aspects of responsibility: Victor’s responsibility for the deadly actions committed by his creation and the threat the creature’s existence poses to his family, friends,
and, Victor fears, the entire world; Victor’s responsibility to his creation for
the creature’s welfare and well-being; and the consequences of this weighty
responsibility for Victor both physically and emotionally.
The novel is a gothic horror—the plot is fantastical, the scenery dramatic, and the hero doomed. But it is also a cautionary tale, with a serious
message about scientists’ and engineers’ social responsibility. Mary conveys
a concern that unchecked scientific enthusiasm can cause unanticipated
harm. For Victor, scientific curiosity threatens the integrity of his family
and disrupts his ability to engage with nature and enter into relationships.
By supplying a protagonist who suffers so greatly as a result of failing
to anticipate the consequences of his work, Mary urges upon her readers
the virtues of humility and restraint. In her development of a creature
who suffers so greatly because he is despised and rejected by an intolerant human society, she asks us to consider our obligations to our creations
before we bring them into being.
The reader is left to wonder whether the story could have unfolded differently if Victor were to have behaved more responsibly. Might he have
anticipated the brute strength of his creation and decided not to create it,
or might he have altered his plan so that the creature would be less powerful and less terrifying? Rather than abandoning the creature, might he
have stepped into his parental role and worked to ensure the creature’s
happy existence? Mary does not tell us what Victor should have done differently—that is the reflective work that we readers must do as we consider our own responsibility to and for our modern-day creations.

When it comes to predicting the future, science fiction writers are Texas
marksmen: they fire a shotgun into the side of a barn, draw a target around
the place where the pellets hit, and proclaim their deadly accuracy to anyone who’ll listen. They have made a lot of “predictions,” before and after
Mary Shelley wrote her “modern Prometheus” story about a maker and his
creature. Precious few of those predictions have come true, which is only
to be expected: throw enough darts, and you’ll get a bull’s eye eventually,
even if you’re wearing a blindfold.
Predicting the future is a mug’s game, anyway. If the future can be
predicted, then it is inevitable. If it’s inevitable, then what we do doesn’t
matter. If what we do doesn’t matter, why bother getting out of bed in the
morning? Science fiction does something better than predict the future: it
influences it.
The science fiction stories that we remember—such as Frankenstein—
are ones that resonate with the public imagination. Most science fiction
is forgotten shortly after it’s published, but a few of those tales live on for
years, decades—even centuries in the case of Frankenstein. The fact that
a story captures the public imagination doesn’t mean that it will come
true in the future, but it tells you something about the present. You learn
something about the world when a vision of the future becomes a subject
of controversy or delight.
If some poor English teacher has demanded that you identify the
“themes” of Mary’s Frankenstein, the obvious correct answer is that she is
referring to ambition and hubris. Ambition because Victor Frankenstein
has challenged death itself, one of the universe’s eternal verities. Everything dies: whales and humans and dogs and cats and stars and galaxies.
Hubris—“extreme pride or self-confidence” (thanks, Wikipedia!)—because
as Victor brings his creature to life, he is so blinded by his own ambition
that he fails to consider the moral consequences of his actions. He fails to
ask himself how the thinking, living being he is creating will feel about
being stitched together, imbued with life force, and ushered into the uncaring universe.

Many critics panned Frankenstein when it was first published, but the
crowds loved it—made it a best seller and packed the theaters where it
was performed on the stage. Mary had awoken something in the public
imagination, and it’s not hard to understand what that was: a story about
technology mastering humans rather than serving them.
When Mary published Frankenstein in 1818, England was getting
completely upended by runaway technological innovation in the Industrial
Revolution. Ways of life that had endured for centuries disappeared in the
blink of an eye. William Wordsworth would soon write mournful letters
and poems about railroads ruining his beloved countryside. Ancient trades
disappeared without fanfare; new careers appeared overnight. Every constant was unmade; the maps were redrawn; and the old, steady rhythm of
life stuttered and pulsed erratically. Young Mary, eighteen years old when
she started writing Frankenstein, felt revolution in the air.
In 1999, Douglas Adams—another prodigious predictor of the present—made a keen observation about the relationship of young people to
technology:
I’ve come up with a set of rules that describe our reactions to technologies:
1. Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary
and is just a natural part of the way the world works.
2. Anything that’s invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is
new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career
in it.
3. Anything invented after you’re thirty-five is against the natural order
of things.
Depending on your age, the truth of Adams’s law—and the terror of the
nineteenth-century readers who relished Frankenstein’s cautionary message about technology mastering its creator—may not be immediately
apparent to you. But we assuredly live in a world of continuous technological upheaval, an Information Revolution that makes Mary’s piddling
Industrial Revolution seem mild by comparison, and that is the reason
we still care about a two-hundred-year-old novel imagining a scientifically
inarticulate project to bring the dead back to life.
“Technological change” isn’t a force of nature, though. The way technology changes and the way it changes us are the result of choices that we
make as toolsmiths, individual users, and groups.
I’ve Created a Monster! (And So Can You) 211
Where Does Technological Change Come From?
Robert Heinlein, a titan of science fiction (as well as a titanically problematic figure), wrote in The Door into Summer (1957), a time-travel novel all
about technological revolution, “When railroading time comes you can railroad—but not before” (120). All through history, inventors doodled things
that looked like helicopters, including, famously, Leonardo da Vinci. But
helicopters didn’t come into existence until a lot of other stuff was in place:
metallurgy, engine design, aerodynamics, and so on. The idea of helicopters
was floating around in our ether, occurring and recurring in the minds of
dreamers, but just because you can think up and design a rotor, it doesn’t
mean you can design a diesel motor, let alone build a Sikorsky that can lift
a tank.
This theory of technological progress is called the “adjacent possible.”
Fanciful inspiration strikes all the time as a consequence of our playful,
unpredictable imaginations. Fancy becomes reality when enough of the
necessary stuff is in place. When it’s railroading time, you get railroads.
Writers had long dreamed of animating dead matter—think of the dirt that
became Adam or the clay that rabbis turned into golems. Mary, living in
the world of Galvinism, industrial and democratic revolution, and the newfound delight in rationalism, was able to give us a golem without resorting
to the supernatural.
But railroading time didn’t just give us railroads: it gave us robber barons who built huge corporate “trusts” that stole from the masses to enrich
the few. It gave us forced laborers, kidnapped or tricked out of China or
shipped from slave plantations, to do the back-breaking work of laying the
tracks. Railroads may have been inevitable, given steel and tracks and
land and engines. Slave labor was not inevitable. It was a choice.
Once the railroads were built, though, choices got harder to make.
Railroads changed the way that farmers sold their wares, changed the way
that settlements were opened and serviced, changed all those things that
freaked out Wordsworth, redrew maps, made industries disappear, and
created new ones. Living as though the railroad didn’t exist was hard, got
harder, and eventually became virtually impossible. Whether it was your
distant business correspondents expecting quick responses to their letters
or what kinds of jobs your kids could get, you couldn’t just opt out of railroads—not without opting out of all the activities your pals and loved ones
undertook on the trains.
How the railroads were built was the result of individual and often
immoral choices. How the railroads were used was the result of a collective 
212 Cory Doctorow
choice made by all the people in your social network: family, friends, bosses,
and teachers.
That’s why there’s no such thing as an Amish village of one. To be
Amish is to agree with all the people who matter to you to make the same
choices about which technologies you’ll use and how you’ll use them.
Let’s Talk about Facebook, the Amish Village with a Billion People in It
Internet social networks were already huge before Facebook: Sixdegrees,
Friendster, Myspace, Bebo, and dozens of others had already come and
gone. There was an adjacent possible in play: the Internet and the Web
existed, and it had grown enough that many of the people you wanted to
talk to could be found online, if only someone would design a service to
facilitate finding or meeting them.
A service like Facebook was inevitable, but how Facebook works was
not. Facebook is designed like a casino game where the jackpots are attention from other people (likes and messages) and the playing surface is a
vast board whose parts can’t be seen most of the time. You place bets on
what kind of personal revelation will ring the cherries, pull the lever—hit
“post”—and wait while the wheel spins to see if you’ll win big. As in all
casino games, in the Facebook game there’s one universal rule: the house
always wins. Facebook continuously fine-tunes its algorithms to maximize
the amount that you disclose to the service because it makes money by selling that personal information to advertisers. The more personal information you give up, the more ways they can sell you—if an advertiser wants
to sell sugar water or subprime mortgages to nineteen-year-old engineering
freshmen whose parents rent in a large northeastern city, then disclosing
all those facts about you converts you from a user to a vendible asset.
Adding the surveillance business model to Facebook was an individual
choice. But using Facebook—now that it is dominant—is a group choice.
I’m a Facebook vegan. I won’t even use Whatsapp or Instagram because
they’re owned by Facebook. That means I basically never get invited to
parties; I can’t keep up with what’s going on in my daughter’s school; I
can’t find my old school friends or participate in the online memorials
when one of them dies. Unless everyone you know chooses along with you
not to use Facebook, being a Facebook vegan is hard. But it also lets you
see the casino for what it is and make a more informed choice about what
technologies you depend on.
Mary Shelley understood social exile. She walked away from the social
network of England—ran away, really, at the age of sixteen with a married 
I’ve Created a Monster! (And So Can You) 213
man, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and conceived two children with him before
they finally married. Shelley’s life is a story about the adjacent possible
of belonging, and Frankenstein is a story about the adjacent possible of
deliciously credible catastrophes in an age of technological whiplash and
massive dislocation.
In 1989, the Berlin Wall fell, and the end of the ironically named German Democratic Republic was at hand. The GDR—often called “East
Germany”—was one of the most spied-upon countries in the history of the
world. The Stasi, its secret police force, were synonymous with totalitarian
control, and their name struck terror wherever it was whispered.
The Stasi employed one snitch for every sixty people in the GDR: an
army to surveil a nation.
Today, the US National Security Agency (NSA) has the entire world
under surveillance more totally than the Stasi ever dreamed of. It has one
employee for every twenty thousand people it spies on—not counting the
contractors.
The NSA uses a workforce less than one-tenth the size of the Stasi to
surveil a planet.
How does the NSA do it? How did we get to the point where the labor
costs of surveillance have plummeted so far in a few decades?
By enlisting the spied upon to do the spying. Your mobile device, your
social media accounts, your search queries, and your Facebook posts—
those juicy, detailed, revelatory Facebook posts—contain everything the
NSA can possibly want to know about whole populations, and those populations foot the bill for its gathering of that information.
The adjacent possible made Facebook inevitable, but individual choices
by technologists and entrepreneurs made Facebook into a force for mass
surveillance. Opting out of Facebook is not a personal choice but a social
one, one that you brave on your own at the cost of your social life and your
ability to stay in touch with the people you love.
Frankenstein warns of a world where technology controls people instead
of the other way around. Victor has choices to make about what he does
with technology, and he gets those choices wrong again and again. But technology doesn’t control people: people wield technology to control other people.
The world’s adjacent possibles will enable you to dream up many technologies throughout your life. But what you do with them can take away
other people’s possibilities. The decision to use a widely adopted technology is never entirely in your personal hands, but what about the decision
to make that technology and how you make it?
That’s up to you.

Aristotle
Frankenstein is a bit like the proverbial elephant, with all those blind men
seeing different things as they touch the trunk or tail or skin. Viewers read
Mary Shelley’s novel and see many wildly different things. The nearly fifty
million Google hits for the word Frankenstein exceed the number of hits
for the word Macbeth, suggesting the popularity and staying power of
this text. Here we ask what the story tells us about conceptions of human
nature and how those conceptions have changed over time.
While we are looking back two hundred years, let us look back a couple
of millennia more. In the fourth century BCE, the Greek philosopher Aristotle set the stage for thinking in terms of “monsters” as deviations from
the normal essence of a species. As a keen observer of nature, Aristotle also
recognized that individuals go through a development process that unfolds
over time. Both of these themes are important for Mary Shelley.
First, about the idea of an essence for a species, or essentialism: Aristotle
was convinced based on what he could observe that the world consists of
different types of organisms. Each organism falls into a particular species
type, in our case the human type. For Aristotle, each type has four causes
that make an individual: the material cause provides the substance; the
formal cause provides a plan that determines the shape; the efficient cause
involves the construction process that make the material the right shape
over time; and the final cause makes an organism come alive as it actualizes the potential for life (Lawrence 2010). These causes require time to
interact, meaning that an organism can become recognized as a member of
its natural type only at the end of the process of generation.
In addition, all living organisms also have what Aristotle called a vegetative soul (which makes it alive); animals have locomotory souls (which
allow them to move around); and humans have rational souls (which give
us reason and emotions). Aristotle’s idea of soul was not religious, but it
was part of his attempt to explain how something could look exactly the
same one minute when a person was alive and different the next minute
when the person is dead. Aristotle explained the difference in terms of the
action of the final cause and the soul (see Aristotle 1943).

216 Jane Maienschein and Kate MacCord
Second is Aristotle’s recognition that making something alive requires
time. It involves a developmental process to bring all these causes and
factors together. Much later the Catholic Church added the idea of “hominization” to indicate the moment when a person becomes alive as a human
being. Aristotle would have insisted that becoming alive does not happen
at one moment but rather only as a process over time. Several millennia
of thinkers have agreed with Aristotle on this point, which remains, at its
heart, the best understanding of development.
Victor Frankenstein and His Creature
Like other intellectuals at the beginning of the nineteenth century, Mary
Wollstonecraft Shelley lived in the shadow of Aristotle. The period later
named the Scientific Revolution (approximately the sixteenth through
the eighteenth centuries) sought to replace parts of Aristotelian natural
philosophy with materialism, empiricism, and experimentation. Materialism emphasized the importance of thinking in terms of material and the
roles of matter in motion as causing what happens in the world, including
life. Materialists rejected, for example, the idea that there is some special life force and maintained that living organisms are made of matter
that changes over time. In contrast, vitalists believed that there is some
kind of vital or life force that makes things come alive—that it takes a life
force to make something a living organism rather than a hunk of clay or
other material. Through these new explanatory frameworks, people began
to explore the living world and ask what causes life to appear in the first
place and then continues to make something alive rather than dead.
Those various attempts to understand life obviously influenced Mary’s
thinking. Empiricism and experimentation called for people to try things
out—that is, not just to rely on past knowledge or what can be learned
from books but to look for ourselves. Victor Frankenstein embraces the call
for experimentation.
Yet Victor seems not to have had a clear view of what makes life happen or about human nature. For some thinkers, such as Paracelsus, among
those who were called the iatrochemists of the seventeenth century, life
requires a particular chemical interaction. For others, electricity imparts
life. Still others thought that heat is the driving factor. Some believed
that life arises through some form of unexplained spontaneous generation.
Or perhaps there is some other life force that drives material to become
animated or alive. Although Victor seems not to have a clear view about
what it is that causes life, he is driven by a conviction that he can make a 
Changing Conceptions of Human Nature 217
creature and cause that creature to acquire whatever it takes and thereby
to become alive. He wants to create life, and Mary uses the term create
quite consciously (Westfall 1977, 82–104).
We are just as fascinated today as Mary’s contemporary readers would
have been about what it takes to make material come to life and what
makes up what we think of as human nature. Today scientists often point
to something about the way cells in embryos divide to produce more and
more cells out of an initially fertilized egg. Those cells contain nucleic acids,
which seem to be essential for life. Strands of deoxyribonucleic acids (DNA)
replicate themselves in ways that allow cells to divide and multicellular
organisms to grow and develop over time. We continue to think of life as
having a material basis. Perhaps unlike Mary’s Victor, we know much more
about what makes something alive, and we also realize how much more we
do not yet know.
What Makes the Unnamed Creature a “Monster”?
In Victor’s creature, we are introduced to a conundrum about human
nature—What makes a monster? Is it physical appearance? This is a strong
possibility; after all, the creature is bigger and stronger than the people it
encounters and “endowed with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome”
(p. 98). In Aristotle’s parlance of causes, we could read within the creature
an interrupted set of formal and efficient causes—that is, an interruption
in the plan and the construction of the material that makes a shape.
Maybe it behooves us, however, to look a little deeper at the nature of
this creature’s putative monstrosity. Although physically aberrant, he is
constructed from human parts and so is endowed with some level of
humanness, at least in the material sense. And although the people whom
the creature encounters recoil from his physical appearance, his form is
recognizable as that of a man rather than that of some other type. In this
sense, he has the essence or “nature” of a human.
What about the creature’s rational “soul” or his intellectual faculties,
which also include emotion and sensations? Are his deficits here what makes
him a monster? This is another strong possibility. He displays behaviors
that challenge his contemporaries’ moral sensibilities—violence, vengeance,
and murder. But these acts are also committed by many people to whom
the label monster might not apply.
To delve a bit deeper into the monstrous nature of Victor’s creation, let’s
return for a moment to Aristotle. Recall that as generation unfolds, the
four causes interact to give rise to a fully realized organism of a particular 
218 Jane Maienschein and Kate MacCord
type. That is, a person is a person and has the nature of a human in particular only because of the process of development.
Why Development Matters
Let’s take a moment to consider the importance of there being a process
of development and why this matters for the creation of a monster and
whether he can become a human person without appropriate development.
Throughout his monologues to his creator, the creature explains that he
had no parents to raise him and that he had to pick up his morals through
stolen conversations and observations. Victor carried out his experiment
and then ran away from it, leaving the mind and behavior of a newborn
bound within an adult body. Victor made the fatal mistake of failing to
understand that producing a life, in the sense of a fully and properly functioning living human, requires development. Babies do not know what is
right and wrong; they have to learn about morals as well as about how to
walk and talk and ride a bicycle and read a book and such things. Aristotle
knew this. Yet some of the enthusiastic materialists of the Scientific Revolution thought that material and material forces might be enough. It is not
clear whether Victor or Mary learned the lesson that development matters
or fell for the illusion that matter is enough.
Mary surely wants us to see that Victor oversteps the bounds of proper
science and medicine with his experiments. The morality tale suggests
that we humans should not try to overreach and create novel beings. We
are, it seems, likely to get it wrong and create a monster.
Yet perhaps this is not the right conclusion. Perhaps instead we should
note that Victor himself also lacks a proper education that has developed
over time. He does not develop his understanding of the world in a systematic way. He seems to jump from one passion to another. At first, he
enthuses about some texts that appeal to him, only to discard them and
embrace others. Then he seeks teachers and learns from them but also pursues his own secret agenda. We do not get a clear sense of why but might
interpret that, like the creature he produces, Victor also fails to develop
appropriate feelings and rationality about the world, including a feeling
for proper scientific experimentation and what it can or cannot tell us.
The point here is that the moral of Mary’s tale is not simply restrictive—that is, “do not mess with creating life”—but also instructive—that
is, be aware that organisms, especially humans, require time and particular stimuli to realize fully the norms of their species.
Changing Conceptions of Human Nature 219
Normal and Aberrant Development
For Aristotle, the four causes interact throughout the generative process,
giving rise to an adult of a particular type. Type (in our case, being human)
is thus the outcome of a regular process of generation. What, then, is the
outcome of an interrupted generative process? And how have people understood this interrupted generative process through time?
There are two points to consider here: type and deviation from the
regular process of development (i.e., the normal way in which something
achieves a type). Within the Aristotelian worldview, a type is a natural
unit, and its members are endowed with particular features that make
them recognizable as belonging to that unit (so long as they go through the
regular course of development). In Aristotle’s estimation, types are essential—that is, they are constituted by sets of attributes that make their
members fundamentally what they are. Essence defines the type but also
defines and gives rise to the organisms within a type.
Let’s look at the idea of type a little bit more closely. The type concept
persisted long beyond Aristotle. Just as Aristotle had done, natural historians of the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries sought to make
sense of and to order the natural world. This ordering often required
recognizing distinctions between organisms and grouping them into neat,
tidy types.
In Aristotle’s estimation, types are unchanging entities, but by the time
Mary wrote Frankenstein, the concept that species are fixed had begun to
be challenged. Part of this challenge came from recognizing that the environment can affect an organism throughout the process of development;
the other part involved understanding that these changes can be passed
from one generation to the next. These two pieces of the puzzle became the
basis for evolutionary theory: Darwin understood them but had no way of
knowing how changes during development could be passed on; this understanding would not come until the twentieth century once the process and
material nature of inheritance were understood.
In Mary’s time, deviation from the regular process of development
was understood to create monsters. In the early nineteenth century, for
instance, Johann Friedrich Meckel (1781–1833) spent the majority of his
career looking for and describing embryological aberrations (O’Connell
2013a). To Meckel, these monstrosities could be explained on the basis
of interrupted development. They were recognized by their deviations
from the norms of development (i.e., their nonadherence to the norms
of the human type). What’s more, these monsters, according to Meckel, 
220 Jane Maienschein and Kate MacCord
represented arrests of development in which the embryo or fetus was stuck
at a stage representing a lower organism in the animal kingdom (Meckel
was a proponent of the idea that development is a readout of evolutionary
history long before Ernst Haeckel [1834–1919] offered his famous recapitulation theory) (Barnes 2014b; O’Connell 2013b). In this system, an interrupted generative process creates a transgression of types.
Theories of deviation from the normal type and altered developmental
processes were co-opted in the later nineteenth century by some scientists
seeking to explain both development and evolution. For instance, Edward
Drinker Cope (1840–1897) and Henry Fairfield Osborn (1857–1935) understood there to be tooth types that organisms could move between throughout evolution. This move, according to Cope and Osborn, was brought about
by changes in the organism’s developmental trajectory (Barnes 2014a). In
this later context, types and movement between them became not so much
about monsters but about evolution.
And in Conclusion, Was the Creature Human?
A human, according to Aristotle, is a being of the human type. It is a creature that has gained the proper form and has followed the proper course
of development (both physically and rationally/emotionally) for the human
type. According to Aristotle’s estimation, then, Victor Frankenstein’s creature cannot be considered a human. We agree.
Victor wants to see the creature as human; after all, he went through
the arduous process of gathering human materials and conducting the
experiments necessary to (re)create life. But in the end Victor doesn’t want
to do the proper developmental work—he abandons his creation, leaving
him in an incomplete state of development. In Aristotelian language, Victor disturbs the formal, efficient, and final causes, leaving the creature
with an ill-formed body and mind of material cause alone.
What if we abandon the Aristotelian framework of the four causes and
focus on the ways in which others among Mary Shelley’s contemporaries
explained life? Let’s return for a moment to the materialists. For a strict
materialist, the only thing necessary to designate something as human is
that it be constructed of the proper matter. Because process isn’t an issue
here, a pure materialist may well deem the creature to be human. However,
very few people have ever been strict materialists in this sense. Material
alone is not enough. A much more common view was that of the mechanist
materialist, who required both that the proper material be present and
that this material be in motion in the correct way. Such a thinker would 
Changing Conceptions of Human Nature 221
not see the creature as human. The mechanistic aspect requires process, and
the motions of material must be started and continued in the right way.
In closing, let’s consider a modern implication of one question Frankenstein raises for our views of human nature. Being a human means being of
the human type, which requires both the form of the matter and also the
process of its development. Only when the matter and process are achieved
together in the proper way can an individual’s humanity be achieved.
The concept of personhood carries additional social interpretations and
is ultimately defined through social convention, yet in our view personhood requires at the very least being fully human in the sense of form and
development.
We recognize that there are many different opinions about what can
and should be counted as a person. Yet development is crucial, and material alone is not enough. Genes and inherited material are not enough.
In this light, personhood, or the designation of a being as a person, can
be conferred only once the process of development is sufficiently complete.
Determining what counts as sufficient to count as a person is a social issue.
Biologically, what counts as a human being is the ability to live independently, with “living” defined according to the best scientific and medical
standards of the day.
To look more concretely at a topic of current interest, some people
claim that embryos have personhood and should be given the legal rights
of a human being. In the sense of humanity or personhood explained here,
this definition would be an inaccurate assessment of embryos. Embryos
are materially of the human type, but they have not yet gone through the
process of development and are not yet persons in this sense. Some people like to suggest that embryos are potential persons in that they might,
under the right circumstances, become persons. Or to put it biologically,
perhaps an embryo or a “monster” that is not a fully formed human might
be taken as having the potential to become a human being. But potential is
not actual. Most of us have many potentials that we never put into action.
It does not make sense to act as if every one of us is already an Olympic
star or concert pianist or math genius just because we may each have the
potential to become these things. It is the actual that matters. The creature is not an actual human in that he has not developed fully. Even after
two centuries, Victor and his not-human creature help inform our understanding of human nature.

Animated by an Almost Supernatural Enthusiasm
“Learn from me … how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge” (p. 35).
Victor Frankenstein’s warning is one reason why his story continues to
fascinate and why books like the present volume are written. The terrible
repercussions of the ambition to become like Prometheus and “animate
the lifeless clay” (p. 39) hold a stark lesson for today. This lesson, however,
is not quite what it is often made out to be. Early on in the book, Victor—
the “modern Prometheus” of Mary Shelley’s subtitle—lets on that his inclination is not so modern after all but is indebted to premodern, mystical
authors such as the alchemists Cornelius Agrippa (Heinrich Cornelius
Agrippa von Nettesheim, 1486–1535) and Albertus Magnus (c. 1200–1280):
I should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside, and, with my imagination
warmed as it was, should probably have applied myself to the more
rational theory of chemistry which has resulted from modern discoveries. It is even possible, that the train of my ideas would never have
received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin. …
It may appear very strange, that a disciple of Albertus Magnus
should arise in the eighteenth century; but our family was not scientifical, and I had not attended any of the lectures given at the schools
of Geneva. My dreams were therefore undisturbed by reality; and I
entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the philosopher’s
stone and the elixir of life. (pp. 21, 22)
For Mary’s readers in 1818, Victor’s aspirations did not fit “in this enlightened and scientific age” (p. 28); they were out of sync with rational theory
and the modern discoveries of chemistry.
So the creature is not a product of modern science, and yet we fancy
Victor as a mad scientist in a laboratory filled with fumes and sparks
from modern apparatus. How is it that this premodern mystical alchemist
appears so contemporary today? The answer is as easy as it is provocative:
perhaps today’s “Frankenfoods” and “Frankenmaterials” are not the products of modern science, either, but a return to alchemical dreams of reason
(Krimsky 1982; Turney 1998).1
 Undisturbed by reality, they are “animated
by an almost supernatural enthusiasm” (p. 33).
UNDISTURBED BY REALITY
VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN’S TECHNOSCIENTIFIC DREAM OF REASON
ALFRED NORDMANN
224 Alfred Nordmann
Indeed, Mary’s novel suggests not only that magic and alchemy preceded science but also that science can infuse and revive their prescientific
ambitions. Victor’s teacher M. Waldman points him in this direction when
he portrays modern science as a rite of passage that will allow Victor to
reclaim the alchemist’s desire to “bestow animation upon lifeless matter”
(p. 37). In and of itself, the world of science is a disenchanted world with
causal knowledge about the arrangements of facts. But before and beyond the
enlightened and scientific age lies a rather more magical world, enchanted
and animated by almost unlimited powers:
“The ancient teachers of this science,” said he, “promised impossibilities,
and performed nothing. The modern masters promise very little; they
know that metals cannot be transmuted, and that the elixir of life is a
chimera. But these philosophers, whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or crucible, have
indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into the recesses of nature,
and shew how she works in her hiding places. They ascend into the
heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature
of the air we breathe. They have acquired new and almost unlimited
powers; they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows. (p. 30)
This description is an apt one, not only of those attempts that are most
readily identified with Victor’s ambitions—to genetically engineer plants
and animals, to technologically enhance human nature, to create artificial
life, and to “banish disease from the human frame, and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death” (p. 23)—but also of the far more mundane achievements of today’s synthetic chemistry, nanotechnology, and
materials science, with ordinary plastics first in line to mock the world
with its own shadows. In 1957, Roland Barthes discussed plastics not as
an application of polymer science but as “the magical operation par excellence: the transmutation of matter”:
This is because the quick-change artistry of plastic is absolute: it can
become buckets as well as jewels. Hence a perpetual amazement. …
And this amazement is a pleasurable one, since the scope of the transformations gives man the measure of his power. … [T]he age-old function of nature is modified: it is no longer the Idea, the pure Substance
to be regained or imitated: an artificial Matter, more bountiful than all
the natural deposits, is about to replace her, and to determine the very
invention of forms. ([1957] 1991, 97–98)
Undisturbed by Reality 225
Plastic signifies the malleability—indeed, the plasticity—of the material
world. With sufficient ingenuity, anything can become anything else; the
wealth of natural forms is mocked by the unbounded inventiveness of
designers; and, in the words of nanotechnologist Gerd Binnig, we are witnesses and shapers of a second creation: “We have to become familiar with
the idea that there is nothing inferior about dead matter. All the wonders
of the world are contained, for example, in a stone, as all the laws of nature
(and thus all the possibilities that can emerge from them) are reflected
in it” (1989, 23). If plastic, according to Barthes, “is in essence the stuff
of alchemy” ([1957] 1991, 97), so are ongoing attempts to transform dead
matter into smart materials, to declare that dirt-repellant coatings make
for self-cleaning surfaces, and to teach refrigerators to report back to us
about milk going bad and eggs running low. These attempts to animate
things, to give them intelligence, or to make them come to life are undisturbed by reality in that they do not accept things as they are in virtue
of their first or original creation. They instead make things subject to a
second creation, presumably of our own making.
Realities of Little Worth
Mary’s tale is not one of modern science. On the contrary, it tells the limits of science and dreams the dream of technoscience, a dream that gains
power in the plastic world of Frankenmaterials.
Science is the theoretical knowledge produced by those who seek to
describe or represent the world and are aided in this quest by technology.
The person who pursues this science is Homo depictor, the Representer;
technoscience is technological knowledge produced by those who seek to
control how things work together and are aided by theory in this effort; the
person who pursues technoscience is Homo faber, the Maker.
Science seeks to understand the world to the extent and in the ways
that humans can comprehend it. Because the human mind is limited, science is essentially modest—the transmutation of matter and the making of
gold from base metals are not on its agenda. Scientists are not interested
in creating the philosopher’s stone to transform lead into gold or the elixir
of life. “It was very different,” says a crestfallen Victor, “when the masters
of the science sought immortality and power; such views, although futile,
were grand: but now the scene was changed. The ambition of the inquirer
seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my
interest in science was chiefly founded. I was required to exchange chimeras
of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth” (p. 29). By definition, 
226 Alfred Nordmann
perhaps, what the mind can comprehend is well proportioned, measured,
and not apt to provoke awe. When we make a model, for example, and
liken the inside of an atom to a miniaturized solar system with planets
orbiting its core, we effectively create a mental image that cuts things
down to size so that we can easily comprehend them. We do so even as
we acknowledge that, really, electrons are not like solid bodies at all but
something that eludes our commonsense conceptions. If science formerly
relied on simplification in order to reduce complexity, to picture and
explain things, this reliance did not stifle the ambition to be creative and
generate complexity even where it surpasses our intellectual powers. The
history of technology testifies to this ambition, and the technology of the
computer allows us to exceed the limits of our science. The statements
that represent slices of reality—each of little worth—can be built into
a complex system of statements simulating a dynamic process that may
also be observed in nature or that is entirely artificial. Either way, with
statements that reduce complexity and simplify things for the purpose
of human understanding, one can now generate a system that quickly
becomes too complex for the human mind: too many lines of code, too
many parameters to keep track of.
On the basis of science but far beyond its limits, we have “acquired
new and almost unlimited powers … can command the thunders of heaven,
mimic the earthquake, and even mock the invisible world with its own
shadows” (p. 30). We have made a machine that serves to model and predict the behavior of complex systems and, in effect, does the work of thinking for us. Quite independently of whether we have solved the problem of
“artificial intelligence” and as unspectacular as the invention of plastic, this
achievement is yet another example of bestowing animation upon lifeless
matter. It is also another example of being undisturbed by reality—that is,
by the limitations of the human mind: “Whence, I often asked myself, did
the principle of life proceed? It was a bold question, and one which has ever
been considered as a mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the
brink of becoming acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain
our inquiries” (p. 33).
Insensible to the Charms of Nature
Unrestrained by cowardice and carelessness, Victor pursues his inquiries
obsessively: “It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields bestow a
more plentiful harvest, or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage: but my
eyes were insensible to the charms of nature” (p. 40). In more ways than one, 
Undisturbed by Reality 227
to the obsessive gaze the world takes on a dual aspect: “To examine the
causes of life, we must first have recourse to death. I became acquainted
with the science of anatomy: but this was not sufficient; I must also observe
the natural decay and corruption of the human body” (p. 33). Nothing is
what it seems: the lively charms of nature harbor decay and corruption;
what is naturally given is a promise or sign of what can be technologically;
and lifeless matter is imbued by a mind, whereas our brain for climate
change is a mere machine.
When things take on such a dual aspect, when they are not what they
appear to be but endowed with secret powers, they become uncanny. This
is the starting point for Sigmund Freud’s famous analysis of the uncanny.
Quoting Erich Rentsch, Freud notes that, “in telling a story, one of the most
successful devices for easily creating uncanny effects is to leave the reader
in uncertainty whether a particular figure in the story is a human being or
an automaton” ([1919] 1955, 227)—or, one might add, whether that figure
is lifeless matter from the graveyard or a living being. Today, it is not just
the robots and zombies in the movies but also the devices that surround
us that, as Freud explains, instill “doubts whether an apparently animate
being is really alive; or conversely, whether a lifeless object might not be
in fact animate” (227). Consider, for example, the ambition to create ambient intelligence in smart environments. As we move through the world, a
network of sensors would collect background information about the quality of air; it would attach Wikipedia entries to the streets and houses we
pass; it would signal the presence of friends, charging stations, and goods.
This world would be a magical one in which all things are endowed with
meaning, subject to our wishes, which may be granted if we conjure the
powers properly—not by praying but by speaking to them or choosing the
right app. With ambient intelligence and ubiquitous computing, the natural environment takes on a dual aspect, and aided by modern science and
technology we advance to a premodern animistic world.2
Not Befitting the Human Mind
Contemporary technoscience is undisturbed by reality in that it flaunts
its inventions that surpass the limited vocabulary of forms and shapes in
nature; it is undisturbed by reality in that it draws on scientific understanding to generate a degree of complexity that exceeds the natural intellectual power of human minds; and it is undisturbed by reality in that it
creates monsters—lifeless things that appear to be animated by a mind or
a soul as well as lively, talkative, and animated things that are merely 
228 Alfred Nordmann
machines. And as we are learning to live and interact with such monsters,
there is nothing particularly terrible or frightening about them, although
they are sometimes a bit unsettling, uncanny, leaving us unsure just what
and who we are dealing with when we eat genetically modified foods, when
we talk to our cell phones, when we watch a computer generate on screen
the right path for a hurricane, when we try to imagine that we wade all the
time through a sea of information-laden radio waves or are surrounded by
electrical wiring in every room of every house.
The dreams of materials science, of information and communication
technology, of biomedical research, of synthetic biology seek to overcome
or transgress the limits of the given world with an almost supernatural
enthusiasm. In the midst of this story, it might be worthwhile to pause and
reflect—only to discover, as Victor did, “that I am moralizing in the most
interesting part of my tale” (p. 40):
A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and
peaceful mind, and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to
disturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is
an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply yourself has a
tendency to weaken your affections, and to destroy your taste for those
simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is
certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human mind. (p. 40)
In an age of technoscience, it has become quite difficult even to understand
this injunction. Are we supposed to achieve perfection merely by taking
pleasure in unadulterated things that are unspoiled by excessive ambition? The dispassionate scientist describes things peacefully as they are,
no matter what good or ill they signify. But there is no such tranquility
when Victor or one of our contemporary technoscientists seeks to perfect
his or her powers on “a dreary night of November”: “With an anxiety that
almost amounted to agony, I collected the instruments of life around me,
that I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my
feet” (p. 41).

Mary Shelley’s enduring novel Frankenstein, considered by some to be the
first science fiction novel in the English language, is often read as a cautionary tale about science and secrets man was not meant to know. I contend
that this interpretation is not so much accurate as incomplete and that in
fact Victor Frankenstein’s choices are fatal not in his desire for knowledge
but in his avoidance of it.
Victor’s crime is not pursuing science but in failing to consider the
well-being of others and the consequences of his actions. I contend also
that Mary’s great work is a tale not about the dangers of a man’s quest
for knowledge but about the ethics of his failure to attempt to anticipate
and take responsibility for the results of that quest. There is a strong link
between Victor’s failure of empathy for his creature and the particular
kind of hubris that allows for the discarding of other people’s lives in service
to an ambition. This failure of empathy is closely connected to the moral
cowardice of refusing to take responsibility for one’s actions or for the outcomes derived from one’s research.
Explicitly in the subtitle of the novel, Mary identifies Victor with the
Greek immortal and trickster figure Prometheus, who among other adventures steals fire from the gods and gives it to man. The trouble with comparing Victor to Prometheus, however, is that in stealing fire, Prometheus
actually accomplishes something of great utility to humanity and is
punished by the gods for his temerity. Victor does indeed step into a role
previously defined by his society as being appropriate to a god—that of
progenitor of life—but Mary makes it evident from the beginning that any
scientific utility in his work is of very little interest to him. He undertakes
his research in a spirit of self-aggrandizement: it’s not knowledge he seeks
but power and renown, and this ambition leads him to become far more of
a monster than the creature he creates.
This motivation is reflected early in his life when he rejects the painstaking and boring—by his standards—research done by contemporary
natural philosophers (who at the turn of the nineteenth century were
beginning to make some real progress in developing the foundations of
science as we practice it today) in favor of the type of research done by the
FRANKENSTEIN REFRAMED;
OR, THE TROUBLE WITH PROMETHEUS
ELIZABETH BEAR

ancients, whose untested ideas, although widely accepted in the medieval
period, had already been discredited by Mary’s time. So Victor seeks the
philosopher’s stone, a mythical substance alchemists believed could grant
eternal life, because it is sexy and because he sees “little worth” in modern—
to him—science.
His purpose in this quest is quite patently glory and fame, not the betterment of the human condition. He gains interest in his contemporary
science only when it seems to offer him a path to this same aggrandizement.
This narcissism, this inability to engage with other creatures beyond their
utility to him and his desire for glory, is his fatal flaw—his hamartia—that
will lead him to isolation, to monstrosity, and—most particularly—to the
destruction of himself and others.
Victor also fails as a parallel to Prometheus in that his eventual failure and punishment are delineated not by divine retribution but by the
inevitable consequences of his own ill-considered choices and refusal to
accept responsibility for the results of his actions. In the course of his selfappointed work, Victor withdraws from the world, his family, and his schooling. He isolates himself in an obsessive quest to create life from death, and
as soon as he succeeds, he rejects his creation for the dubious sin of being
unattractive, abandons it, and takes to his bed in a fit of emo pique.
As soon as he achieves his obsession, he rejects the accomplishment,
and catastrophe results.
It’s relevant to this point that Mary’s text is marked by a cursory and
much-undermined veneer of Christianity. For the time, this irreligion
is unusual, though it appears typical of Mary’s life experience. And yet
Christianity is often portrayed as the religion of compassion: the word compassion itself derives from that religion, from com (with) and passion (suffering), as in “the Passion of the Christ.” Compassion is literally, then, to
experience suffering in empathy with another.
Victor himself professes to be a Christian, and a great deal of his internal
conflict stems from his feelings that he has betrayed his faith and usurped
the rights of his creator in imbuing life into dead flesh. But he never considers that he has failed in a far more sacred duty of Christianity: the
Golden Rule upon which the religion is founded. He’s such an incredible
narcissist that instead of offering this compassion, this sharing of the suffering of others, he discards people when they are inconvenient, including
his supposedly beloved family and fiancée. His treatment of his creation is
really no different.
FRANKENSTEIN REFRAMED 233
So, in other words, Victor professes Christianity, but he is a terrible
example of it—especially to his creation. He’s a lousy parent—a lousy
creator—because of his selfishness, his self-absorption, and his lack of
foresight. He makes no sacrifices of the kind that would be appropriate for
the education and upbringing of a sentient creature whose existence he is
responsible for. He cannot even accept his creation as a fellow sufferer in
need of succor and charity. And when confronted with the terrible murders
of those close to him, rather than feeling pity or compassion, he uses his
religiosity to justify how much worse his suffering is than theirs because
they are dead and in heaven, while he remains on earth, suffering guilt.
(But one of the victims dies while her soul is burdened with a false confession, which seems, in a Christian worldview, as if it might result in a little
time in purgatory, at the very least.)
Although we can’t know, of course, what Mary’s religious outlook was
in its entirety, we do know that she was raised by free thinkers, married
an atheist, and was a social radical for her time, with determined opinions
about the equality of women and the role of liberated sexuality in society.
Significantly, one of her more noble and courageous characters, the beautiful Arabian Safie, is the product of a Muslim father and a Christian mother.
Safie chooses to espouse her mother’s religion seemingly not out of any
deep conviction but rather entirely because it offers her greater freedom
and legal protection.
Safie is also a marginalized person—a woman and a Muslim—but even
she can find at least a flawed asylum in a family where women are treated
as human beings even if not as equals. Her experience raises the question
of where the creature might seek such asylum—then as now.
Victor, in other words, is as tremendous a religious hypocrite as he is
a scientific one. His monstrousness and abnormality are manifest in his
behavior, even though Robert Walton, the ship’s captain and explorer to
whom he relates his tale and who serves as the reader’s intermediary for
understanding Victor’s life, sees him as nobly countenanced and well spoken. Victor is a beautiful man and fairly obviously a spoiled and indulged
one, though he himself does not realize this, even at the end of his life.
Victor and those around him think of him as a noble intellectual. But his
intellectual achievements pale in comparison to those of his creation, who
teaches himself in the span of a few years to read, to speak several languages, to navigate a ship, and to comprehend the nuances and hypocrisies
of human society.

And yet because the creature is ugly, he is spurned first by his creator
and then by every other human person he meets, despite the apparently
innate goodness of his impulses. Mary makes it plain that though the creature is manufactured as a blank and willing pupil, he is benevolent in
spirit and wishes only to help, to be accepted by human society, to find
companionship. It is only after repeated abandonments and rejections that
he becomes violent and vengeful.
Victor, the hypocrite, has no such excuse for his own monstrosity. He
simply is incapable of considering the needs or desires or even the safety
of anyone beyond his own immediate gratification. He cannot rise above
his own innate selfishness and his ingrained tendency to dismiss, deny,
and abandon something he considers ugly and unnatural—even though it
is his own creation. Even worse, Walton—who in many ways represents
the better aspects of human character—cannot see his way past Victor’s
beauty and the creature’s ugliness to the truth of their relationship and of
Victor’s abandonment and abuse of his creation. As with all literature, the
reader sees his or her own best and worst aspects reflected in the narrative,
externalized so they can be examined with new insight.
Victor is such a narcissist, in fact, that it never occurs to him that the
creature might take revenge for Victor’s refusal to manufacture a companion for him by killing Victor’s own intended wife and life companion. He
assumes that he himself will be the focus of any such revenge.
Victor is incurious about the results of his actions, which is an enormous failing in a scientist. I admit, personally, to a fair quantity of scientific curiosity about exactly how Victor preserves the “materials” he uses,
as he so euphemistically describes them. His world is one without refrigeration beyond ice houses, and he mentions spending months collecting
body parts and then assembling his creations before imbuing the first one,
at least, with the “spark of life.” To the scientifically minded reader of 1818,
this phrase would have been a transparent reference to the explorations
of such near-contemporaneous scientists as Luigi Galvani (1737–1798),
Giovanni Aldini (1762–1834), and Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790) as well
as to a long-brewing debate over vitalism and the origins of life. Many
early nineteenth-century readers would have been familiar with and perhaps even have witnessed infamous public experiments where human and
animal corpses jerked briefly to life through the application of electricity.
The novel is pointedly vague on the details of Victor’s work. I have a
rather unpleasant image of Victor wandering around England for some
time with two hundred pounds of grave-robbed body parts in a steamer
trunk, taking them out each night to dry them on racks before the fire. 
FRANKENSTEIN REFRAMED 235
Walton’s description of the creature—the only actual description of him,
other than Victor’s noting his filmed eye, great stature, and horrible countenance—mentions that his hand is “in colour and apparent texture like
that of a mummy” (p. 183).
I also find myself wondering, in the interests of science, if Victor’s fears
of the monster breeding with the bride Victor begins to make for him could
not be simply addressed by, oh, leaving out the ovaries and womb of the
female creature? One does rather wonder how effective mummified testes
are in producing viable creature germ cells. …
My point here is to reinforce that Victor really doesn’t think things
through, which is an aspect of his monstrosity: the fatal flaws that result
in his destruction are that incuriousness and that narcissism.
But the creature has a fatal flaw as well: it is his desire for vengeance
when he is ostracized. Whereas Victor’s self-isolation is a symptom of his
innate monstrosity, it is his ostracization of the creature—the creature’s
othering, to use the modern parlance—that turns his creation into a monster.
Thus, failing to consider the impact of his decisions on the creature
he creates and then compounding that failure with selfishness and lack of
compassion, Victor causes the very carnage that so desolates him. And so
he becomes the author of his own ruined life and of the ruined lives of so
many more innocent others.
This relationship is pointed out quite brilliantly at the climax of the
book, when Walton is confronted by the remainder of his fast-dying crew,
who wish to abandon their quest for the Northwest Passage and return
to warmer southern waters. Victor berates them as cowards, almost literally
with his last breath. And yet, in the end, Walton chooses his men’s safety
over his own selfish desire for glory and discovery as well as over Victor’s
demand that he continue the obsessive, vengeful quest to destroy Victor’s
creation.
Walton stands in contrast to Victor in this choice, which creates a thematic counterpoint to those decisions Victor makes that destroy him and
his much-abused family and friends. In fact, Walton treats his own quest
for knowledge responsibly. He considers the well-being of others, and he
maintains his human connection to his family—personified by a beloved
sister to whom he writes at every opportunity—throughout his adventures.
That he turns back is not a scientific defeat—he makes no grand declarations about the impossibility of his quest for knowledge and pens no
polemics about the uselessness of further ventures.
236 Elizabeth Bear
Rather, Walton demonstrates a simple acceptance that Victor never
manages to embrace: other human lives have worth and value. Even those
of a group of nameless sailors.
Victor himself states the problem, even as he is unable to comprehend
how thoroughly he has failed to compass it: “In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature, and was bound towards him, to assure,
as far as was in my power, his happiness and well-being. This was my duty;
but there was another still paramount to that. My duties towards my fellowcreatures had greater claims to my attention, because they included a
greater proportion of happiness or misery” (pp. 181–182). He does not
number his own creation among his fellow creatures, although in truth
he owes it a greater debt than he does to any other person because he is
responsible for its existence and abandonment. As the creature itself says,
“Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all human kind sinned against
me?” (p. 185).
Because the creature looks like a monster, he is treated as one despite
his initial benevolence, and so he becomes one. Because Victor looks like an
angel, he is treated as one despite being a monster, and he never grows and
changes. The great tragedy of his life is that if he had simply considered
the moral implications of his work and chosen a different course or if he
had accepted his own debt of care to his creation from the beginning and
nurtured it—if he had, in other words, behaved as a responsible scientist—
every tragedy for which he bears the guilt would have been averted (and
he might have received the accolades he so desired).


On 16 June 1816, Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin gave birth to one of the
enduring myths of modern civilization, the narrative of the scientist who
single-handedly creates a new species, a humanoid form that need not
die. In her novel Frankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus (1818), Victor
Frankenstein robs both cemeteries and slaughterhouses in order to suture
together a creature composed of dead animal and human body parts, a
creature he then animates with the “spark of being” (p. 41). In doing so,
he claims he has renewed life where death had apparently devoted the
body to corruption. Victor thus realizes the age-old wish of humankind
to transcend mortality, to become a god. And like Prometheus, who in
ancient myth both shapes the human species out of clay and then steals
fire from the Olympian gods to give to man, Victor expects to be revered,
even worshipped.
But in his hubristic quest to become God, to create an immortal species,
Victor constructs a creature that eventually destroys his wife, his best friend,
and his baby brother, so exhausting Victor that he dies at an early age. Mary
Shelley’s novel has thus become the paradigm for every scientific effort to
harness the uncontrollable powers of Nature and the unintended consequences that those efforts have produced, be they nuclear fission, genetic
engineering, stem cell cloning, or bioterrorism. The popular conflation of
the scientist with his creation—such that “Frankenstein” is as often the
name of the creature as of his maker—only points to a profound understanding of Mary’s novel in which Victor finally becomes as filled with
hatred, revenge, and the desire to destroy as the creature he hunts across
the Arctic wastes. The novel implicitly suggests an alternative. Had Victor
Frankenstein taken responsibility for his creation, had he loved, nurtured,
and disciplined his creature, he might have created the superior species of
which he dreamed.
How did the eighteen-year-old Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin (later
Shelley) come to write a tale so prescient of modern science? Two years
earlier, on 28 July 1814, Mary had left her home in London to go to France
with the married poet Percy Shelley. Seven months later she gave birth
prematurely to a baby girl, called Clara, who lived only two weeks, after
FRANKENSTEIN, GENDER, AND MOTHER NATURE
ANNE K. MELLOR
240 Anne K. Mellor
which she had a recurrent dream that her little baby came to life again,
that it had only been cold, and that she rubbed it before the fire, and it
lived. Immediately pregnant again, Mary gave birth to her son William
on 24 January 1816. Four months later Mary, Percy, and her stepsister
Claire left England to join Claire’s new lover, Lord Byron, and his doctor,
John William Polidori, in Geneva. Kept indoors by the coldest summer
in a century following the eruption of the volcano Tambora in the Indonesian archipelago in April 1815 (which threw so much debris into the
stratosphere that the sun was literally blocked out across India, Europe,
and North America), reading ghost stories for their amusement, the four
friends decided on 16 June 1816 to have a contest to see who could write
the most frightening story.
That night Mary had the “waking dream” or reverie that provided the
germ of Frankenstein. Born from Mary’s own deepest pregnancy anxieties
(What if I give birth to a monster? Could I ever wish to kill my own child?),
her novel brilliantly explores what happens when a man attempts to have
a baby without a woman (Victor Frankenstein immediately abandons his
creature); why an abandoned and unloved creature becomes a monster;
the predictable consequences of her day’s cutting-edge research in chemistry, physics, and electricity (most notably the experiments conducted by
Erasmus Darwin [1731–1802], Humphry Davy [1778–1829], and Luigi
Galvani [1737–1798]); and the violent aftermath of the French Revolution.
Mary drew psychologically on her own childhood experiences of isolation
and abandonment after her mother’s death in childbirth and her father’s
remarriage to a hostile stepmother to articulate the creature’s overwhelming desire for a family, a mate of his own, and the consequences of his
violent anger when he is rejected by all whom he approaches, even an innocent young boy, William Frankenstein (modeled on William Shelley), and
then his maker. By including an image of the murder of her own son, William, in the novel, Mary articulated her deepest fear that an unloved (and
psychologically abused) child, such as she herself had been, could become
an unloving, abusive mother, even a murdering monster.
Given Mary’s parentage, it is unsurprising that gendered constructions
of the universe are everywhere apparent in Frankenstein: for example,
Victor’s identification of Nature as female—“I pursued nature to her hiding
places” (p. 38, emphasis added). Victor’s scientific and technological exploitation of female Nature is only one way in which the novel consistently
represents the female as passive and able to be possessed, the willing
receptacle of male desire. Victor’s usurpation of the natural mode of human
reproduction implies a kind of destruction of the female. We see this 
FRANKENSTEIN, GENDER, AND MOTHER NATURE 241
destruction erupt symbolically in his nightmare following the animation
of his creature: while in his embrace, Elizabeth, his bride-to-be, is transformed into the corpse of his dead mother—“a shroud enveloped her form,
and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel” (p. 43). By
stealing the female’s control over natural reproduction, Victor has eliminated the female’s primary biological function and source of cultural power.
Indeed, as a male scientist who creates a male creature, Victor eliminates
the biological necessity for females at all. One of the deepest horrors of this
novel is his implicit goal of creating a society for men only: Victor’s creature
is male; he refuses to create a female; there is no reason why the race of
immortal beings he hopes to propagate should not be exclusively male.
On the cultural and social level, Victor’s scientific project—to become
the sole creator of a superior human being—supports a patriarchal denial
of the value of women and of female sexuality. Victor’s nineteenth-century
Genevan society is founded on a rigid division of sex roles: men inhabit the
public sphere, women are relegated to the private or domestic sphere. The
men work outside the home, as public servants (Alphonse Frankenstein),
as scientists (Victor), as merchants (Henry Clerval and his father), and as
explorers (Walton). The women are confined to the home, kept either as a
kind of pet (Victor “loved to tend on” Elizabeth “as … on a favourite animal”
[p. 18]) or as housewives, childcare providers, and nurses (Caroline Beaufort, Elizabeth, Margaret Saville) or as servants (Justine Moritz).
As a consequence of this division, public intellectual activity is segregated from private emotional activity: Victor cannot work and love at the
same time. He cannot feel empathy for his creature and chooses to work
with large body pieces because doing so is easier and faster, despite the fact
that his creature will be a deformed giant. And he remains so self-absorbed
that he cannot imagine his creature might threaten someone other than
himself on his wedding night. The separation of the sphere of public (masculine) power from the sphere of private (feminine) affection also causes
the destruction of most of the women in the novel. Caroline Beaufort dies
from scarlet fever caught when she alone volunteers to nurse the contagious
Elizabeth. Justine, unable to prove her innocence in the death of William,
is condemned to death by Victor’s refusal to take responsibility for his creature’s actions. And Elizabeth is murdered on her wedding night. The novel
offers an alternative to this gendered division of labor in the egalitarian
relationships in the De Lacey family, where brother and sister together
share the duties of supporting their father, and Safie (an independent
woman based on Mary Shelley’s feminist mother, Mary Wollstonecraft) is
welcomed as Felix’s partner. But this ideal family is ripped out of the novel 
242 Anne K. Mellor
when the creature enters their household, suggesting that Mary herself
did not think such an ideal family could prosper in her time.
Why does Victor finally refuse to create a mate for his creature, an Eve
for his Adam, after having promised to do so? He rationalizes his decision
to destroy the half-formed female creature:
I was now about to form another being, of whose dispositions I was
alike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant
that her mate, and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness. He had sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man, and hide himself in deserts; but she had not; and she, who in all probability was to
become a thinking and reasoning animal, might refuse to comply with
a compact made before her creation. They might even hate each other;
the creature who already lived loathed his own deformity, and might
he not conceive a greater abhorrence for it when it came before his
eyes in the female form? She also might turn with disgust from him to
the superior beauty of man; she might quit him, and he be again alone,
exasperated by the fresh provocation of being deserted by one of his
own species.
Even if they were to leave Europe, and inhabit the deserts of the new
world, yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the
dæmon thirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon the earth, who might make the very existence of the species
of man a condition precarious and full of terror. Had I a right, for my
own benefit, to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations? (p. 139)
What does Victor truly fear that causes him to rip up his half-finished
female creature? First, he is afraid that this female will have desires and
opinions that cannot be controlled by his male creature. Like French Genevan philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s (1712–1778) natural man, she
might refuse to comply with a social contract made by another person
before her birth—namely, between the creature and Victor himself; she
might assert the revolutionary right to determine her own existence. A
second fear is that her uninhibited female desires might be sadistic: Victor
imagines a female creature “ten thousand times” more evil than her mate,
who would “delight” in murder for its own sake. Third, he fears that his
female creature will be uglier than his male creature, so much so that even
the male will turn from her in disgust. Fourth, he fears that she will prefer
to mate with ordinary human males; implicit here is Frankenstein’s horror
that, given this female creature’s gigantic strength, she would have the
ability to seize and even rape a man she might choose. And, finally, he is 
FRANKENSTEIN, GENDER, AND MOTHER NATURE 243
afraid of her reproductive powers, her capacity to generate an entire race
of similar creatures.
What Victor truly fears is female sexuality as such. A woman who is
sexually liberated, free to choose her own life and her own sexual partner (by force, if necessary), and able to propagate at will can only appear
monstrously ugly, even evil, to him because she defies the sexist aesthetic
that insists that women should be small, delicate, modest, passive, and
sexually pleasing but available only to their lawful husbands. Horrified by
this image of uninhibited female sexual desire and power, Victor violently
reasserts a male control over the female body, penetrating and mutilating
the female creature in an image that suggests a violent rape: “trembling
with passion, [I] tore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged” (p. 140).
The next morning, when he returns to the scene, “the remains of the halffinished creature, whom I had destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I
almost felt as if I had mangled the living flesh of a human being” (p. 143).
However, in Mary’s feminist novel, Victor’s efforts to control and even
to eliminate female sexuality altogether is portrayed not only as horrifying and finally unattainable but also as self-destructive. For Nature is not
the passive, inert, or “dead” matter that he imagines. Victor assumes that
he can violate Nature and pursue her to her hiding places with impunity.
But Mother Nature both resists and revenges herself upon his attempts.
During his research, Nature denies to Victor Frankenstein both mental
and physical health: “Every night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and
I became nervous to a most painful degree” (p. 41). When he decides to
create a second creature and again defy natural reproduction, his mental
illness returns: “[E]very word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips
to quiver, and my heart to palpitate. … [M]y spirits became unequal; I
grew restless and nervous” (pp. 134, 138). Finally, Victor’s obsession with
destroying his male creature exposes him to such mental and physical
fatigue that he dies of natural causes at the age of twenty-five.
Appropriately, Nature prevents Victor from constructing a normal
human being: his unnatural method of reproduction spawns an unnatural
being, a freak of gigantic stature, watery eyes, shriveled complexion, and
straight black lips. His creature’s physiognomy then causes Victor’s revulsion from his child–invention and sets in motion the series of events that
finally produces the monster that destroys his family, friends, and self.
Moreover, Nature pursues Victor with the very electricity, the “spark
of being,” that he has stolen: lightning, thunder, and rain rage around
him as he works. Rain pours down on the “dreary night of November” on
which he completes his experiment (p. 41). When he returns to Geneva, 
244 Anne K. Mellor
he glimpses his creature on the Alps through a violent storm and flash of
lightning. After destroying the female creature, he sets sail to dispose of the
remains in the ocean and is caught up by a fierce wind and high waves
that portend his own death—“I looked upon the sea, it was to be my grave”
(p. 144). Victor ends his life in the arctic regions, surrounded by the ice,
the aurora borealis, and the electromagnetic field of the North Pole. The
novel’s atmospheric effects, which most readers have dismissed as the traditional trappings of gothic fiction, in fact manifest the power of Nature
to punish those who transgress her boundaries. The elemental forces that
Victor has released pursue him to his hiding places, raging around him like
the female spirits of vengeance, the Furies of Greek drama.
Mary’s novel not only portrays the penalties of violating Nature but
also celebrates an all-creating Nature that is loved and revered by human
beings. Those characters capable of feeling the beauties of Nature are
rewarded with physical and mental health. Henry Clerval’s relationship
to Nature, for example, represents one moral touchstone in the novel.
Because he “loved with ardour” “the scenery of external nature” (p. 132),
he is endowed with a generous sympathy, a vivid imagination, a sensitive
intelligence, and an unbounded capacity for devoted friendship. And it is
no accident that the only member of the Frankenstein family still alive at
the end of the novel is Ernest, who rejects the career of lawyer to become
instead a farmer, one who must live in harmony and cooperation with the
forces of Nature, one who lives “a very healthy happy life; and … the most
beneficial profession of any” (p. 48).
As Frankenstein finally shows, an unmothered child, like a scientific
experiment that is performed without consideration of its probable or even
its unintended results and that radically changes the natural order, can
become a monster, one capable of destroying its maker. The novel implicitly endorses instead a science that seeks to understand rather than to
change the workings of Mother Nature. Mary’s novel thus resonates powerfully with the ethical problems inherent in the most recent advances in
genetics: the introduction of germ-line engineering through CRISPR-Cas9
techniques of DNA alteration and the current scientific possibility of producing what Victor Frankenstein dreamed of, a superhuman “designer
baby.” At the same time, the novel vividly illustrates the terrifying ramifications and unintended consequences of such attempts to “improve” the
human species.


Technical sweetness. Scientists and engineers use this phrase when a puzzle’s solution presents itself, when all the pieces fit beautifully and functionally together, when success at the particular endeavor presents itself
in a neat package. Technical sweetness is alluring, consuming, and, as we
can see in the story of Victor Frankenstein, potentially blinding to what
might follow from the solution being sought. Scientists who are driven by
technical sweetness can fail to see what might be obvious to those with a
bit more distance—that despite some projects’ allure, sometimes completing
the project is not desirable.
When Victor first discovers the secret to life, he is so overwhelmed by his
success that he fails to share it with his colleagues and instead accelerates
toward a full-fledged test of his insight—Can he animate a body devoid
of life? In his desperation to complete this test, he pushes himself to the
breaking point, fully in the thrall of the technical sweetness of his work.
He stops communicating with his friends and family and disengages from
the social connections that might give him a better perspective on his pursuits. He senses that all is not right—that his reluctance to share his work
might mean something more than a desire to guard the secret until confirmation is achieved; only once his creation awakes does he realize that it
might not have been a good idea to create such life. Indeed, he recoils from
what he has done, running from his creation for two years. In the end, he
spends the rest of his life in a dark dance with the creature, attempting to
forestall further horrors from being inflicted upon humanity.
Victor is, of course, a fictional character in a gothic horror story, but
the arc of his work—from the capture of his imagination by an idea to the
theoretical discovery (which he refuses to share), to the sequestration of
his work until a complete empirical manifestation of it, to a revulsion in
his ultimate success, and finally to an embrace of his responsibility and
pursuit of his creation in an attempt to restrain it—is not something that
resides solely in the realm of fiction. Such an arc can be found in one of the
most momentous scientific projects of the twentieth century: the creation
of the first atomic bombs.
THE BITTER AFTERTASTE OF TECHNICAL SWEETNESS
HEATHER E. DOUGLAS

The story of the pursuit of the atom bomb is not a perfect reflection of
Victor’s story because the former involves the work of many scientists, not
just one. It is also the story of an endeavor that was constantly in the
shadow of fraught moral decisions and catastrophic world war. But much
of the arc of this story mirrors the arc of Frankenstein, and the lesson of
the need to resist the allure of technical sweetness is made manifest even
amid the complexities.
In late 1938, Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch discovered the process of
fission in atomic nuclei and spread the word throughout the international
physics community. Before this discovery, most physicists thought that
using nuclear physics for practical purposes like energy production and
weapons was utterly impractical, and indeed some relished this lack of
practical application of their work. But with the discovery of fission, all
that changed. The nuclear physics community in the United Kingdom and
the United States immediately began not only to speculate about but also
directly to investigate whether fission opened the door to practical use,
whether enough neutrons resulted from the fission of a uranium nucleus
to support a chain reaction, and what sorts of materials could be used
to increase the likelihood of a chain reaction. By December 1942, Italian
physicist Enrico Fermi created the first self-sustained nuclear reaction
(with slow neutrons) in a laboratory located in the squash courts beneath
Stagg Field at the University of Chicago, and the Manhattan Project to
build that bomb (a fast neutron reaction) was well under way. The Manhattan Project comprised research and development at many sites, especially
large industrial sites at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Hanford, Washington,
as well as the building of Los Alamos Laboratory, where scientists were
sequestered to research how to design and test the first atomic weapons.
Scientists traveled to the isolated Los Alamos site under secrecy and,
once there, were under strict orders not to discuss the project outside of the
inner laboratories, called the Technical Area. Scientists were focused on
achieving the goal, a workable atomic weapon, and not on whether doing
so was a good idea. Given most scientists’ impetus—concern that the Nazis
might develop such a weapon first—such a focus was understandable.
Situated at the timberline more than seven thousand feet atop a mesa
in New Mexico, Los Alamos was a heady atmosphere in which to work: led
by the brilliant J. Robert Oppenheimer, filled with past and future Nobel
Prize winners, and pressurized by the war. The site grew rapidly from about
one hundred people in the spring of 1943 to more than six thousand by the
end of the war (Bird and Sherwin 2005, 210). The scientists at Los Alamos
confronted a number of technical challenges, particularly regarding how 
THE BITTER AFTERTASTE OF TECHNICAL SWEETNESS 249
to ensure that maximum energy would be released from the hard-to-collect fissile material being produced at Oak Ridge (enriched uranium) and
Hanford (plutonium) (Rhodes 1986, 460–464). But by late 1944, the initial
impetus behind the program was undermined. Reports coming back from
successful Allied pushes into German territory revealed that the Nazis’
atomic efforts were nowhere close to producing weapons. In fact, Germany
had failed to produce a functioning nuclear reactor, something achieved in
the United States two years earlier.
For one scientist, Polish physicist Joseph Rotblat, the realization that
the original motivation to produce an atomic weapon had evaporated provided sufficient reason to leave the project. He resigned from Los Alamos
in December 1944. However, before his departure, he was forbidden from
discussing his decision with the other scientists at Los Alamos (Brown
2012, 55). A moment for moral reflection among the Los Alamos scientists
was lost.
By May 1945, even as the European war came to an end, work on the
weapon accelerated. Oppenheimer recalled later that the scientists never
worked harder than in the summer of 1945 (Szasz 1984, 25). Producing a
weapon before the end of the war, that could be used to end the war, became
a paramount driver, in part because many of the scientists at Los Alamos
had shifted their justification for pursuing the weapon to the ending of all
wars. Many thought that only if the weapon were used to end the current
war would humanity appreciate how truly destructive such weapons could
be and thus be motivated to end war permanently.
Efforts at Los Alamos from February 1945 through the summer were
focused on a test of the plutonium bomb. Because of the much more complex
mechanism needed to produce a weapon with plutonium, scientists were
quite unsure whether it would work. Only a trial with real plutonium could
produce an adequate test of the mechanism. This test would be the Trinity
test, the first atomic explosion on the planet, held on 16 July 1945.
The work leading up to this test was nothing short of feverish. Getting
all the technical details, calibrating measuring equipment, and creating
contingency plans took massive effort. Three possible outcomes presented
themselves: (1) the test weapon could be a dud, no more powerful than a usual
ordnance explosion; (2) it could be massively destructive, killing many on
site and causing a national emergency; or (3) it could be the weapon they
hoped for, impressive but not out of control (Szasz 1984, 79). Much to the
relief of the scientists present, the last possibility proved accurate, which
meant that their work was a success and that they had produced a usable 
250 Heather E. Douglas
weapon. They had not wasted their effort during the war, and they had
survived to tell the tale.
The scientists reacted in different ways to their success. The first thing
Oppenheimer said when the bomb went off was an exultant “It worked!”
The scientists had mostly expected a much smaller explosion, as revealed
by the betting pool for the yield at Trinity (Szasz 1984, 65–66). Oppenheimer picked the equivalent of three hundred tons of TNT; most scientists
picked yields much less than ten thousand tons. In fact, the weapon produced a yield closer to twenty thousand tons of TNT. Along with relief and
excitement at the technical success, the visual and visceral impact of the
explosion impressed many of the witnesses. Oppenheimer later recalled
that these words from the Bhagavad Gita went through his mind: “I am
become death, the destroyer of worlds” (quoted in Szasz 1984, 89). I. I. Rabi
was at first thrilled but then overwhelmed by the implications of what he
and his fellow scientists had done (Szasz 1984, 90). As Victor Weisskopf
wrote, “Our first feeling was one of elation, then we realized we were tired,
and then we were worried” (quoted in Szasz 1984, 91). The technical sweetness of the project was over, and now the scientists had to confront what
their success meant in the full complexity of the world. Test director Kenneth Bainbridge quipped, “Now we are all sons-of-bitches” (quoted in Bird
and Sherwin 2005, 309).
It took time for some of the scientists to fully grasp the moral weight of
what they had done. After the use of the weapons at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which helped bring a sudden end to the war, many of the enlisted men
at Los Alamos celebrated, but the scientists were subdued and sometimes
physically sick, overwhelmed by what they had helped achieve (Bird and
Sherwin 2005, 317). When Phil Morrison and Bob Serber returned from
Japan to Los Alamos at the end of October 1945 with firsthand accounts
of the impacts of the bombs (Bird and Sherwin 2005, 321), scientists who
had worked on the project now faced the grim reality of their success and,
seeing it clearly, committed themselves to making their work as beneficial
for humanity as possible.
Different scientists sought to shoulder responsibility for their creation
in different ways. Some worked to ensure that atomic power was placed
under civilian control, and their efforts led to the US Atomic Energy Commission. Some sought to forestall an arms race with the Soviets by advocating for international control of atomic technology. Some spread the word of
how destructive the bombs were, hoping to prevent all future wars. Some
pursued even more powerful weapons, their sights set on keeping Soviet 
THE BITTER AFTERTASTE OF TECHNICAL SWEETNESS 251
totalitarianism at bay. And some pursued the peaceful uses of the atom.
None escaped a sense of responsibility for their work.
We can see in the arc of the story of scientists at Los Alamos echoes
of Victor Frankenstein’s story. From the intense pursuit to the dawning
realization of the downsides of success and the attempt to ameliorate such
success, such parallels were noted at the time. In notes for a meeting of the
Interim Committee (a high-level policy committee for nuclear weapons)
on 31 May 1945, Secretary of War Henry Stimson wrote that the bomb
“May destroy or perfect International Civilization, May [be] Frankenstein
or means for World Peace” (quoted in Rhodes 1986, 642, emphasis and
capitalization in the original). For the scientists engaged in the project, the
Frankenstein nature of it remained out of focus until its completion. With
technical success and technical sweetness attained, the fraught moral
questions that came with success clarified painfully.
Mary Shelley’s novel Frankenstein is a prescient parable, a gripping
nontheistic version of Goethe’s Faust that spells out the horror that can
accompany success as we pursue science and technology. Even as science
has grown as an enterprise, even as the collective nature of the scientific
endeavor has become clear and big science has taken a more central place
in scientific culture, the arc followed by Victor—the solitary scientist—is
still relevant. Whether scientists work by themselves or in collaboration,
they continue to confront the allure of technical sweetness and its blinding power as they grapple with their responsibilities for their work in the
twenty-first century.
Scientists whose work suddenly raises the red flag—for example, those
whose work gets labeled “potential dual-use research of concern”—often
balk at the imposition of restrictions and the requirement of deeper reflection. The lure of technical sweetness, of continuing to pursue success in
their area of expertise, makes it hard for those scientists to see, much less
weigh seriously, the downsides of their work. Even with increasing efforts
to create structures through which scientists can address the thorny problems that can arise when pursuing new scientific and technical capacities,
technical sweetness can still blind them to the need to reflect on the implications of their work and the imperative to act, before completion, to
ameliorate the impact of success.

FURTHER READING

VOLUME I
PREFACE
Many have identified Frankenstein as a book of science fiction—indeed, as even the
first of that genre in the English language. In the preface, Mary Shelley writes, “The
event on which the interest of the story depends … was recommended by the novelty of the situations which it developes; and, however impossible as a physical fact,
affords a point of view to the imagination for the delineating of human passions” (p. 1).
What is she suggesting about the relationship between science fiction and truth? Do
you agree with her? Why or why not?
LETTERS
Why has Mary included the letters Captain Walton writes to his sister, Margaret? Do
they help you understand the scientific context in which Victor (and Mary) operate?
The social context? In what ways is Captain Walton like Victor? In what ways is he
different? Do your views of him change from the beginning to the end of the novel?
In the last of the letters, Victor slips into the language of fate and predetermination.
In what ways is his future fated, and in what ways is it of his own making? Why is he
here using the language of fate?
CHAPTER I
What do we learn about Victor, his family, and his friends from this opening chapter of
Mary’s narrative? Would you call Victor’s childhood “Edenic”? What are the implications of identifying it as such?
How did the young Victor approach reading, learning, and science? What kind of things
impressed him or failed to impress him?
CHAPTER II
When Victor goes off to the University of Ingolstadt, he has become a “mother-less
child,” believing himself “totally unfitted for the company of strangers” (p. 28). How
does this view of himself influence the way he approaches his studies? Have you
ever felt this way when you have gone off to school or camp or elsewhere? If so, how
did it affect the way you approached your tasks?
Have you ever had a teacher accuse you of reading “nonsense,” as M. Krempe does of
Victor? If so, how did you react? How is M. Krempe correct or incorrect in his assessment of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus?
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS
264 Discussion Questions
Who might be on the reading lists that M. Krempe and M. Waldman provide Victor
(roughly around 1790)? M. Waldman shows Victor the machines in his laboratory.
What might those machines have been? What did a laboratory of the late eighteenth
century or early nineteenth century look like?
CHAPTER III
How does Victor approach his studies at the University of Ingolstadt? How is this
approach different from your approach to your studies? How does Victor choose a
mentor? Do you have a mentor? How would your studies be different if your mentoring situation were different?
How does Victor learn about “the principle of life” (p. 33)? In what venues do his
inquiries take place? Are his inquiries limited to the laboratory? In what ways does
contemporary research span laboratory research and research outside the laboratory?
What biological materials are used in a modern university? What rules govern the
their use? How did these rules come about? Are rules different for human biological
materials and nonhuman materials? Should they be?
Has discovering something about the natural world ever made you unhappy? Has
learning something new in any endeavor ever made you unhappy? In either case, did
you decide in the end that it was better to know or not to know? What other stories,
fact or fiction, can you think of about knowledge causing unhappiness?
Why does Victor choose not to reveal his discovery to anyone or to consult with anyone
about his determination to animate a creature based on his discovery? Is it right to
keep discoveries secret? Are there examples of discoveries that have been kept secret,
at least for a time? Should they have been kept secret?
Have you ever neglected other duties—your friends or family, your other classes,
sports or art or entertainment—because of your commitment to a scientific or creative endeavor? How did it feel while you were doing this? How did it feel afterward?
CHAPTER IV
Why is Mary’s description of the laboratory context of the “instruments of life” (p. 41) so
vague? Compare this scene to the many film reenactments of it (especially the Edison
Studios film in 1910, the Universal Pictures film directed by James Whale in 1931,
and the TriStar Pictures film directed by Kenneth Branagh in 1994). How are they
different? How are they the same? Do the different media give you different ideas
about what the science is like? What the ethics are like?
Does Victor use both human and animal material in making his creature? What is
the textual evidence, one way or the other? Does it matter to your understanding of
the creature’s status if it has animal as well as human parts? Does it matter to your
understanding of contemporary human beings if doctors repair their hearts with valves
from pigs or transplant baboon hearts into their chests? What about plastic valves,
metal joints, or artificial hearts? What about artificial brains?
Discussion Questions 265
Some (feminist) critiques of Frankenstein point out that Victor succeeds in creating a
motherless creature. Would a female creator have behaved differently toward her
creature? Could a woman have done what Victor did in his day? Can a female scientist do what a male scientist can do today? Would a female scientist have made the
creature? Do women do different science or do science differently than men?
CHAPTER V
Victor “conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy” (p. 51).
Is there any extent to which he might be right in blaming the entire field of study or
its overall perspective? Are there fields of inquiry to which you have an “antipathy,”
if not a violent one? What is that hostility based on? Is it moral? Is it metaphysical?
Parenthood can be emotionally challenging, as exemplified by the prevalence of postpartum depression among new mothers. Victor also falls ill in the wake of his animation of the creature, and his friend Henry Clerval nurses him back to health. Why
in this period, which goes on for many months, does Victor completely ignore the
creature’s disappearance? What is his emotional state during this time, and in what
ways is he like or unlike a parent?
CHAPTER VI
Upon returning to Geneva following William’s death and seeing his creature there,
illuminated by a flash of lightning, Victor states that “[t]he mere presence of the idea
was an irresistible proof of the fact” (p. 58) that the creature was the murderer. Have
you ever had such leaps of intuition that you immediately knew they were true, even
without evidence or investigation? Is that the kind of understanding you associate
with a scientist?
CHAPTER VII
Justine is convicted in a murder trial largely on the basis of circumstantial evidence.
She was found in possession of the locket that had been on the murdered boy William
and could not provide an alibi. How is the use of knowledge different in the law and in
science? Are the stakes different? Should knowledge in law and science be identical?
Should justice always be predicated on truth?
Why do you think Elizabeth’s testimony has no influence on the jury?
How does religion influence the creation of knowledge in Justine’s trial? How does it
influence Victor’s and Elizabeth’s response to the execution of Justine? Why does
Justine confess to a crime she did not commit and does not even understand, whereas
Victor refuses to provide evidence about which he is certain?
VOLUME II
CHAPTER I
Victor does not seek forgiveness from those he loves, choosing instead to withdraw
further from human society. Are his choices so far forgivable? Why or why not?
266 Discussion Questions
CHAPTER II
Why would Mary choose such an awe-filled and sublime environment as the Alpine
glacier for the confrontation between Victor and the creature? Is it just dumb luck
that both Victor and the creature end up there?
Why does the creature not accept Victor’s offer to fight, a fight that the creature would
most surely win?
In this chapter, Victor finally expresses some ambivalence and even self-doubt—about
the circumstances of William’s murder and about his treatment of the creature. Why?
CHAPTER III
How credible do you find the creature’s account (or, rather, Walton’s account of Frankenstein’s account of the creature’s account) of his early days and weeks? Do you find
it surprising that the creature is such an exacting observer? Why or why not?
Why do the people the creature meets react to him with fear or hostility or both? Is it
the same fear with which Frankenstein reacts?
How are the creature’s “childhood days” like or unlike Victor’s described at the outset
of the novel?
CHAPTER IV
What do we learn about the creature from his interaction with the old man and the
two young people who live in the cottage? What does the creature learn about himself?
What is the creature’s view of spoken language? Of what importance is it for him to
say that he “learned and applied” (p. 91, emphasis added) specific words? What is the
difference between the words he learns and applies quickly and those that are still
difficult for him?
How does the creature hope to overcome the “deformity” to which he attributes the
inspiration of fear and hostility in the humans he meets? Is this hope reasonable?
CHAPTER V
What is the significance for the creature of Safie’s arrival at the cottage? What does her
presence mean for his understanding of language? Of emotion?
Again like Victor earlier in the novel, the creature experiences the ambivalence of
the acquisition of knowledge—sometimes it is greatly for his benefit, but sometimes
it causes pain. How does the creature experience this ambivalence? How does he
propose to manage it?
Whereas the earlier chapters—for example, those about Victor’s gathering of research
materials—remind us more of contemporary biomedical research, the narrative of the
later chapters, when the creature starts to find his own voice, is more reminiscent
of issues with artificial intelligence. How do you imagine the creature’s experience
compares with that of a machine that has a dawning consciousness?
Discussion Questions 267
CHAPTER VI
Why does the creature think that he has to produce copies of the letters between Safie
and Felix in order for Victor to believe him?
What is the purpose of the creature’s long digression into the affairs of the De Lacey
family and of Safie and her family? What can we learn about Victor and the creature
through comparison with these two families’ experiences?
CHAPTER VII
Mary has the creature stumble upon Paradise Lost (Milton), Plutarch’s Lives, and The
Sorrows of Young Werther (Goethe). What three poems, histories, or novels (or even
songs or other creative works) would you choose to educate a creature created today?
Each of us imagines that we are a singular “I” with a unitary body and mind and
genetic makeup. At various times, this imagination comes under assault: Freud
opened up the world of the subconscious, fracturing the unitary mind. More contemporary discoveries of the importance of microbiota pose the problem of a fragmented body,
even after a long history of replacement of lost limbs with prostheses. Contemporary
discoveries of chimerism can fragment our genetic unity. In so many ways, the “I” is
really a complex collective. What are the implications of such fragmentation, and what
are its consequences for understanding who we are as well for the pursuit of science
and technology? Does it provide us with new motivations? Does it result in different
kinds of knowledge or different kinds of technologies?
The creature says he read Paradise Lost as a “true history.” What mistakes do we make
when we read fiction as fact? How do we know?
It turns out that Victor did make notes or keep a journal of his experiments, and the
creature finds them and reads them, although the reader is never given any details
from them. How would these notes differ from the letters exchanged elsewhere in
the novel?
If you were designing a creature that you intended to be sentient and sapient, what
form or type would you give it? Why? Would it depend on its function? Would you take
into account its feelings, if any, regarding how it looks, or would you take into account
the feelings of the people among whom it would live and work?
The creature refers to his designed encounter with the elder De Lacey as a “trial.”
How is this trial like or not like the other trials in the novel—for instance, those of
Justine and Victor?
CHAPTER VIII
When the creature arrives in Geneva and meets William, the child’s identity is unknown
to him, and he does not have murder on his mind. He imagines that William is too
young to have formed a prejudice against his deformity, but he is wrong and in his
anger and discovery of William’s identity strangles the boy. Where does William’s
prejudice (or fear) come from? Why is the creature wrong about William’s innocence
of such knowledge?
268 Discussion Questions
At the end of the chapter, the creature announces his plan to Victor: that Victor create
for him “one as deformed and horrible as myself [who] would not deny herself to me”
(p. 120). The creature recognizes himself as intelligent, and he has all of Victor’s notes
about how he was made. So why doesn’t the creature himself make his mate or propose
to Victor that he teach him or that they collaborate in the making of his mate? Why
does he demand, “This being you must create” (p. 120)?
CHAPTER IX
Victor concludes about the creature’s proposition that “justice due both to him and
my fellow-creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his request” (p. 123).
What competing forms or definitions of justice are at play here?
If you were Victor, would you agree to make the creature a mate? Why or why not?
Are there perhaps other, unexplored possibilities?
VOLUME III
CHAPTER I
Why does Victor delay fulfilling his promise to the creature? What reason do you think
is most important?
Mary is very self-conscious of the social impossibilities in her world—for example,
that women, people from lower social classes, immigrants, non-Christians, and slaves
cannot partake in the full range of social and political possibilities that are reserved
for people (usually men) of privilege. This problem is represented in this chapter
by Elizabeth’s inability to accompany Victor on his two-year jaunt across Europe.
Frankenstein is also a novel about technical possibilities and impossibilities. How
do social (im)possibilities and technical (im)possibilities play into each other in the
novel? Does the relative lack of technical impossibility help us understand or feel
differently toward the presence of social impossibility?
CHAPTER II
Why is there no account of what Frankenstein learns from his contacts in London,
“the information necessary for the completion of my promise” (p. 133)? What might
Victor need to learn to assemble a female creature that he did not already know?
Victor refers to himself as “a blasted tree; the bolt has entered my soul” (p. 135). To
what does this refer? How might you compare Victor’s metaphor of being struck by
lightning to the creature’s experience of the “spark of life”?
There are differences between how Victor approaches his first experiment and how he
approaches his second experiment, despite his solitude in the latter. What are they?
Is there a relationship between his different attitudes and their respective outcomes?
Does Victor have a clearer sense of the second experiment’s potential outcomes? Why?
Can we fully think things out in advance?
Discussion Questions 269
CHAPTER III
Why does Victor decide to destroy the new creature? Is it simply because of the first
creature’s appearance and a “countenance [that] expressed the utmost extent of malice and treachery” (p. 140), observed in the dimmest of light? If the creature had not
appeared, would Victor have finished his work?
The confrontation between the creature—“You are my creator, but I am your master;
—obey!” (p. 141)—and Victor in this chapter is perhaps the most dramatic scene in
the novel. Is the creature’s wrath justified? Have the tables turned as thoroughly as
the creature imagines? Does Victor fully understand the scope of his decision not to
cooperate with the creature’s demands?
What else must Victor believe if he believes that creating a new creature would be an
act of “the basest and most atrocious selfishness” (p. 144)? Can he reasonably hold
this belief in his head while at the same time feeling that he “was about the commission of a dreadful crime” (p. 144) when he is disposing of the torn-apart remains of
the second creature?
CHAPTER IV
Victor refers to destiny often in this chapter. Is choice now extinguished for him, and
is fulfilling his destiny all that he has left to do? In what does Victor see his destiny?
Are there points when he could have changed it? Is destiny the same thing as path
dependency?
Compare the respective legal cases against Justine and Victor and how they play out.
What are the crucial pieces of evidence? How do the accused and the judicial authorities behave? How do the physical evidence, the circumstances, and other factors come
together for a verdict?
CHAPTER V
Why does Victor continue to insist to his father that he is a murderer?
CHAPTER VI
Why does Victor not tell Elizabeth about the creature, especially before or at least
on their wedding night? Are his potential reasons the same as or different from his
reasons for not telling his father or Clerval?
Why does Victor skip quickly over his period of madness after Elizabeth’s murder and
his father’s consequent death? Might he have been subject to another trial, this time
for the murder of his bride?
Victor finally tells the whole story to someone in this chapter—a magistrate of
Geneva—who listens politely and then interestedly but uses elements of Victor’s own
story about the timeline and the creature’s superior power in his refusal to assist
Victor. Is this denial ironic? A condemnation of bureaucracy? A convenient plot device?
270 Discussion Questions
CHAPTER VII
Victor expresses an extensive oath (or small prayer?) in this chapter, seemingly the
first time he has invoked some religious or quasi-religious power. Where does this
oath come from? Does his turn to spirituality here have anything to do with his experience with science? With law?
Why does Victor makes a distinction between the “ardent desire of [his] soul” and
“the mechanical impulse of some [external] power” (p. 170)? Is this distinction easy
to make for him? For us? Can Victor’s creature make such a distinction? If we were to
make such a creature today, would it be able to do so?
WALTON’S LETTERS (CONTINUED)
Why, in his letter to Margaret, does Captain Walton tell her that he really believes
Victor’s story? Is Victor’s account sufficient?
Even if science fiction, Mary’s novel is set in the past. Given that the novel is told
through letters and stories passed from one person to another, do you think the readers of its day might have taken it as a real-life, nonfiction account? As an alternate
history? As something like the radio broadcast of H. G. Wells’s The War of the Worlds
in 1938?
Walton quotes Victor as calling the creature a “sensitive and rational animal” (p. 175)
and then shortly afterward “a man” (p. 175). Is the former a good and full definition of
the latter? How do we define personhood today? Can personhood include nonrational
animals? Rational nonanimals? Is personhood unitary, or can there be different varieties of it?
Victor recognizes that he has a duty to support “his [creature’s] happiness and wellbeing” and a duty to humanity “paramount to that” (p. 181). What is the logic of Victor’s
assigning the duty to humanity the paramount value? Is this view utilitarian—emphasizing the good of the many over the good of the one? Is it communitarian—that the
creature really doesn’t belong to a broader community, whose values and safety are
more important than the outsider’s? Is Victor’s logic here instead simply an excuse for
his earlier mistakes? Are there times when the logic of privileging the larger number
over the smaller number is incorrect and we should risk the well-being of the community for the individual?
Across the novel, there is something of a comparative ethics of suffering: Victor asserts
that his suffering is greater than Justine’s, and Walton overhears the creature claiming that his suffering is greater than Victor’s. Is there any sense to be made of these
comparisons? Can one being suffer more than another? Can suffering be objectively
determined? Or is it entirely subjective? Is my suffering always more than yours simply
because it is mine?
Do you agree with Walton that the creature does not feel true remorse but instead
feels only frustrated that Victor is now free of him?
Do you believe the creature will extinguish himself? If you believe that promise, then
do you believe the rest of his representations of his feelings and intentions? Why or
why not?
Discussion Questions 271
ESSAYS
JOSEPHINE JOHNSTON, “TRAUMATIC RESPONSIBILITY”
The novel portrays an extreme case of scientific responsibility, but all of us are implicated in situations where we are responsible to moral standards, to particular ideas,
and to other people. What kinds of responsibility do you have as a scientist, a citizen,
a creator, a human being? How do you define these responsibilities? And what does
it mean to “feel” them?
Johnston argues that Victor experiences two forms of responsibility: responsibility
for and responsibility to. Are there other kinds of responsibility, in particular forms of
shared or collective responsibility?
CORY DOCTOROW, “I’VE CREATED A MONSTER! (AND SO CAN YOU)”
Doctorow’s essay argues that science fiction is not really about predicting the future
but rather about understanding the present. What does Mary’s novel, which was presumably written for a present two hundred years old, have to tell us about scientific
practices today? Is it still relevant, or do we need new stories to confront the present?
According to the theory of the “adjacent possible,” technological change comes “when
enough of the necessary stuff is in place” (p. 201). According to this logic, discovery can
proceed only through so many pathways, and what’s coming always depends on what
has come. Do you agree with this view, or do you think that true surprise and serendipity are possible? Is the direction of scientific progress somehow predetermined?
Doctorow argues that although technological changes are often the result of individual
choices, how they are used becomes a collective choice. Using the example of Facebook,
he talks about how disavowing a surveillance society is a difficult social choice—but
still one that you can make as an individual. What collective choices concerning
contemporary technologies do you disagree with, and what would it take for you to
opt out?
JANE MAIENSCHEIN AND KATE MACCORD, “CHANGING CONCEPTIONS OF HUMAN NATURE”
Maienschein and MacCord believe that Mary’s story is both “restrictive” and “instructive.” What do you think they mean by this? Do you agree with their assertion? Does
Frankenstein go beyond these parameters?
What is your answer to the authors’ question “Is the creature human?”? If the creature
is not human by the end of the novel, is there any way for it to become so?
What do you think the relationship is between what the authors call the biological concept of “human” and the social concept of “person”? Can one easily or neatly demarcate
the social from the biological in this way?
ALFRED NORDMANN, “UNDISTURBED BY REALITY”
Nordmann’s essay suggests that modern incarnations of the creature, such as “Frankenfoods” and “Frankenmaterials,” are not scientific outcomes but a throwback to 
272 Discussion Questions
alchemy and the supernatural. What is the relationship between science and belief
today? When we entrust ourselves to an airplane or an algorithmic credit-scoring
system, are we engaging in an act of reason or a leap of faith?
The publication of Mary’s novel predated the modern term scientist by almost twenty
years, and Nordmann argues that her novel is “not one of modern science” (p. 223).
Is Victor a scientist? Would we recognize him as one today? If not, how would you
describe him in contemporary terms?
Nordmann argues that contemporary technoscience is “undisturbed by reality”; in
other words, we are creating materials, ideas, and life-forms that have no corollary
in nature. At its most fundamental level, is science about understanding the natural
world or about creating a structure of knowledge that may or may not resemble the
reality we perceive?
ELIZABETH BEAR, “FRANKENSTEIN REFRAMED; OR, THE TROUBLE WITH PROMETHEUS”
Bear suggests that Victor’s central character flaw is his lack of empathy. Do you agree?
Is empathy an important faculty for the conducting of scientific research?
The other great character flaw that Bear highlights is Victor’s narcissism. The great
critique of scientific reason at the dawn of the Enlightenment was precisely this: that
it was pure hubris for humanity to imagine itself at the center of the universe, to
displace the external existence of God for a structure of knowledge built within our
minds. Do you think the pursuit of scientific discovery is a fundamentally narcissistic
enterprise or a humbling one? Can one be a successful and humble scientist, engineer,
or creator?
Bear talks about the fact that Victor’s beauty, his handsomeness, leads people to
treat him better than they treat his creature. What role do you think beauty plays or
should play in scientific discovery? Is the search for truth also a search for beauty,
to paraphrase the poet Jonathan Keats, Mary’s contemporary?
ANNE K. MELLOR, “FRANKENSTEIN, GENDER, AND MOTHER NATURE”
Frankenstein was initially published anonymously, and some critics or reviewers
speculated that Percy Shelley wrote it. Do you think a man could have written
Frankenstein as Mary Shelley wrote it?
Given Mellor’s interpretation of the novel, what do you make of contemporary accounts
that change Victor’s gender—for example, the PBS digital series Frankenstein, MD,
featuring a Victoria Frankenstein, or the children’s book series Franny K. Stein by
Jim Benton? If the creator at the center of the story was raised and socialized as a
woman, in Shelley’s time or today, would her relationship with her creation change?
If so, how?
Are today’s scientists and engineers who are involved in synthetic biology and other
similar endeavors engaged in motherless creation?
Discussion Questions 273
HEATHER E. DOUGLAS, “THE BITTER AFTERTASTE OF TECHNICAL SWEETNESS”
How close is the analogy between Victor’s work and the work of the atomic scientists
in the 1930s and 1940s?
Do you believe that the pursuit of “technical sweetness” is one reason why Victor
completes his experiment?
If creating life is so technically sweet and technical sweetness is important in making
the creature, why doesn’t Victor make the creature a mate?

“This new, remarkable annotated edition of Frankenstein with its accompanying essays
brings the ‘modern Prometheus’ flawlessly into our century in a manner sure to inspire
scientists and nonscientists in a conversation that Shelley herself might not have foreseen but surely would have encouraged.”
Arthur L. Caplan, Drs. William F. and Virginia Connolly Mitty Professor, founding head of the
Division of Bioethics at the School of Medicine, New York University
“This wonderful new edition is a happy addition to the critical literature examining the
meaning of the tale for our twenty-first-century commitments to heroic science, engineering, and technology.”
Rachelle D. Hollander, Director, Center for Engineering Ethics and Society, National Academy
of Engineering
“The Promethean tale of Frankenstein is a rich source of questions about the price that
scientists and the public pay for knowledge. This annotated edition rescues the classic
allegory from popular culture’s caricature and presents it with a framework for exploring
the questions raised. Among the many questions, perhaps the most important is, when
scientists either from amoral arrogance or negligent lack of foresight present a discovery
society is not prepared to deal with—nuclear weapons, engineered gene lines, climate
modification—what is the scientists’ responsibility going forward? Is it merely to watch
in horror as the knowledge is unleashed on society?”
